# Mattermost Handbook

The purpose of this handbook is to _**iteratively increase clarity**_ for Mattermost staff and community co-building the future of our company and our offerings. 

It's Day 1 at Mattermost. We're a growing company and growing open source project out to support the massive transformation underway as open source software unlocks the massive potential of people and teams around the world. 

The "Mattermost Handbook" is a continual work-in-progress for _Mattermost staff_--people who are paid to work on our open source software and to help run the company behind our software.

Early in our history, when we were a much smaller company, [our staff handbook was included in our product documentation ](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/core.html) and we are incrementally moving out of our documentation and into the dedicated repository at [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook) which is edited using GitBook as a frontend. 

Some norms you'll see here in the handbook: 

## Growing companies are a work-in-progress  

As an open source company we like to share early. Sharing ideas early gets us feedback sooner, so we can iterate faster, so we can better results. 

We have a mindset of [1% and 50% drafts](company/about-mattermost/mindsets.md#drafts-at-1-50-99) that express how complete our thinking is around proposal we're reviewing.   
  
When a section of the handbook is at less than the 50% draft stage you should see it labeled in the page description with the % draft status. When a section doesn't have a % draft status, assume it's over the 50% draft stage. 

We believe this system has two key benefits: 

1. **Be more open to feedback and iteration** - Having something published publicly can make it seem overly "final". By having pages in our handbook at 1% and 50% we make it easier to go through feedback and iteration cycles.  
2. **Engage more non-technical people in the discussion** - In the past, we have done reviews largely in GitHub pull requests, which is friendly and familiar for technical team members, but more difficult for others. Sharing 1% and 50% drafts in the public for feedback makes our process more inclusive. 

There are trade-offs as well: There may be confusion among people who haven't been onboarded into the [1%, 50% draft](company/about-mattermost/mindsets.md#drafts-at-1-50-99) concept. People who are not comfortable with the level of early sharing may feel upset. For these reasons, this page itself is only a 10% draft, so opinions can be expressed and discussed.

## Sharing feedback on this handbook 

Feedback on this handbook is immensely appreciated. Here's how you can share: 

1. Click the Edit on GitHub link in the top right corner of the page
2. Click on the line in the text on which you want to comment
3. Copy the link that's offered to reference the link
4. Click on "Issues" in the head of the GitHub page and create a new issue referencing the line and sharing your feedback

That begins the cycle of feedback and iteration. While not all feedback will result in an update to the handbook, we definitely want to hear everyone's opinion.
