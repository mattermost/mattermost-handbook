# Helpdesk

The Mattermost IT team provides technical support to all Mattermost staff members and is dedicated to servicing the technology support needs of all staff by providing detailed resolutions and general system information for common problems.

Through the internal helpdesk solution, staff members are able to request application access, elevated permissions, assistance with troubleshooting software/hardware issues, flag security issues, and ask for help with integrations, as well as submit general inquiries.

## Availability

Helpdesk services are available during the following hours of operation, except during office closures and company observed holidays:

* Monday through Friday **9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. EST**

Emergency support is available during the following hours of operation:

* Monday through Friday **7:00 a.m. - 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. - 11:00 p.m. EST**
* Saturday and Sunday **9:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m. EST**

### Severity levels

Support is available outside of working hours in the case of an emergency. Any issue classified as **Urgent** is considered an emergency. **High** level incidents may also fall under scope as an emergency depending on the request.

* **Urgent** - System failure. Immediately impacts the overall operation of the business.
* **High** - Outage that is affecting a single, or small subset of staff from functioning properly (work blocked significantly without a workaround in place), or there is a time-sensitive issue important to long term productivity.
* **Medium** - Issue that does not have a significant productivity impact. Work can still be performed.
* **Low** - Non-urgent issue that requires resolution without time-sensitivity.

## Response times

Between normal hours of operation please see below for the maximum expected response time based on the severity of the request:

* **Urgent** - 1 hour
* **High** - 2 hours
* **Medium** - 4 hours
* **Low** - 8 hours

Expect a response the next business day if the request is submitted outside of normal hours and is not an **Urgent** severity request.

## Making a request

All staff members have access to make a request via the helpdesk portal (https://helpdesk.mattermost.com). Depending on the issue, IT may require a meeting via Zoom, or to troubleshoot via Mattermost.

When submitting a ticket please provide detailed information to help speed up the troubleshooting process:

* Device or platform with which you require assistance (laptop, desktop, Jira, Outreach, etc.).
* A clear and specific description of the problem or request, including information regarding any error messages you may have received.

## Service scope

All requests considered an **Incident** or **Service Request** are covered under the service scope.

* An **Incident** is considered 'an unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service'.
* A **Service Request** is considered 'a request for something to be provided - for example, a request for information, access to a platform, or change within an existing platform'.
