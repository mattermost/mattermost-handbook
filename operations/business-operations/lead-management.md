# Lead Management

## What is a lead?
Leads are defined within our CRM across a variety of types. Sales will engage primarily with Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) which are broadly defined by leads which characterize a potential intent to purchase the product. See here for a [list of MQL definitions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15dLbn2A72PE9abrGHKUsZLOaKxjZhUsz4MzmqO9k4uE/edit?usp=sharing).

Sales will either engage with MQLs in an automated or manual fashion as defined in the [sales engagement document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VlabDMukHNC-FSip9tKftTmXfYnOLqkg19WiGZqNmjA/edit).
