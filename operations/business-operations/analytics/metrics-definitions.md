## Finance

Financial numbers cater to a wide range of teams. Below you will find information on ACV, TCV, and ARR. **ACV & TCV are relevant to Sales and ARR relevant to Finance and CS.**

### TCV \(Total Contract Value\)

_**What the customer bought**_

* TCV measures revenue from across the entire contract a customer signs
* Recognized **only** in the Closed Won Month
* `TCV = Total Contract Value`

### ACV \(Annual Contract Value\)

_**What the customer bought annualized for the first year of their contract**_

* Recognized **only** in the Closed Won Month
* Calculation for deals &gt;= 12 months
  * `ACV = (Total Contract Value / (End Date - Start Date)) * 365`
* Calculation for deals &lt; 12 months
  * `ACV = Total Contract Value`

### ARR \(Annual Recurring Revenue\)

_**What the customer bought normalized for one year length & reoccurs for length of contract**_

* ARR is the value of the contracted recurring revenue of your term subscriptions normalized to a one-year period
* Recognized from **start to end** of contract
* `ARR = (Total Contract Value / (End Date - Start Date)) * 365`
* ARR increases and decreases based on the following categories of change:
  * New: New Logo never seen before - Caused by a brand new and never before see Account signing a contract
  * Expansion: Increase in ARR by an Account - Caused by seat increase, price increase, or product upgrade
  * Contraction: Decrease in ARR by an Account - Caused by seat decrease, price decrease, or product downgrade
  * Churn: Decrease in ARR to $0 by an Account - Caused by an Account moving completely off of Mattermost

### TCV vs. ACV vs. ARR

Example: 

* Opportunity: [Example Opportunity](https://mattermost.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0063600000eRMmcAAG/view)
* Close Date: 2019-05-07
* Amount = $250
* Start Date: 2019-06-15
* End Date: 2022-06-14
* Metrics Breakdown \(see graph below\):
  * ACV one-time $83 in May 2019 
  * TCV one-time $250 in May 2019 
  * ARR $83 from June 2019 until June 2022

## Google Analytics

All Google Analytics data in Snowflake is at a **daily** level. See [limitations](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/business-operations/analytics/metrics-definitions#google-analytics-limitations).

### Organic Traffic

* Organic Web Traffic is the **daily** unique visitors to \*.mattermost.org, \*.mattermost.com who originate from non-paid sources
* Organic Search Traffic is the **daily** unique visitors to \*.mattermost.org, \*.mattermost.com who originate from an organic Google search

### Google Analytics Accounts

1. mattermost.com
2. about.mattermost.com \(old mattermost.com\)
3. mattermost.org
4. developers.mattermost.com
5. integrations.mattermost.com
6. docs.mattermost.com
7. handbook.mattermost.com
8. licensing.mattermost.com
9. mattermost.gitbook.io/jira-plugin
10. pre-release.mattermost.com \(which is old community.mattermost.com\)
11. mattermost.zendesk.com

### Google Analytics Limitations

* [Stitch](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/business-operations/data-engineering#stitch-data) is used to pull Google Analytics data into Snowflake
  * Stitch is only able to pull data at a daily level
  * Aggregating up daily level to a monthly level causes double counting of users that may have visited the site more than one time in a given month.

## Hiring

* WIP

## Net Promoter Score \(NPS\)

* Net Promoter Score \(NPS\) measures customer experience and predicts business growth
* Respondents are grouped as follows:
  * Promoters \(score 9-10\) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others
  * Passives \(score 7-8\) are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable
  * Detractors \(score 0-6\) are unhappy customers who can damage your brand
* Net Promoter Score = % Promoters - % Detractors
  * NPS ranges from -100 \(every customer is a Detractor\) to 100 \(every customer is a Promoter\)
* Mattermost's NPS is based off of a 1-10 ranking provided by customers
  * If customers provide rankings 2+ times in a day, the last ranking of the day is used for NPS

## TEDAS

TEDAS stands for _Telemetry-Enabled Daily Active Servers_. It is the count of unique, [production servers](metrics-definitions.md#server-condsiderations) sending telemetry \(“activity"\) data to Mattermost on a given date. Each component of TEDAS can be described as follows:

* Telemetry Enabled:
  * Servers that are telemetry enabled have “Error Reporting and Diagnostics” or “Security Alert” enabled in System Console.
* Daily Active:
  * Servers are classified as active on a given day when they respond to Mattermost's call to collect telemetry data.
    * For a server to respond, it must be online and telemetry enabled.
* Servers:
  * Servers host Mattermost instances for teams & organizations.
  * Each team or organization can have one-to-many servers installed to host their instance.
    * Small/Medium teams typically leverage a single server.
    * Large teams can leverage Enterprise Edition features to create server clusters that allow them to scale their instance.
  * _**Non-production servers**_ ****are not included in TEDAS calculations.
    * Test and development servers are non-production servers that can be spun up for testing and various other use cases.

### Server Considerations

TEDAS only measures the count of active production servers. The Mattermost.server\_daily\_details is used to calculate TEDAS and only contains these production servers. The table is derived from the Events.security table. Production servers are inserted into the Mattermost.server\_daily\_details table using logic to filter the Events.security table.

* Events.security table logs all server responses to Mattermost's call to collect telemetry data.
  * Server types include test, development, and production servers.
* Logic to identify production servers within the Events.security table is as follows:
  * Version matching recognized format
    * `version LIKE '_.%._._.%._'`
    * Other version formats are not valid because they indicate a test, development, or custom built instance
  * No "Dev Builds" and "Ran Tests" recorded
    * `dev_build = 0`
    * `ran_tests = 0`
  * Registered Users &gt;= Active Users
    * `user_count >= active_user_count`
    * Data anomalies occur causing servers to show  active users &gt; provisioned users - these servers must be excluded.

### TEDAS Caveats

There are additional data quality issues within the Events.security table that need to be addressed before inserting the verified production servers and calculating TEDAS. The Events.security table is supposed to contain 1 record per server per day. This is not always the case: ~2% of server id's have multiple rows per day. To select a single record per production server we must:

* Identify the row per production server containing the maximum number of active users on the given date.
  * If the maximum number of active users = 0 then we select the most recently logged row based on the "hour" field value.

## TEDAU

**TEDAU** stands for _Telemetry-Enabled Daily Active Users_. It is the sum of all "Active Users" logged by [telemetry-enabled production servers](metrics-definitions.md#server-condsiderations) on a given date. The TEDAU calculation sums the "active\_user\_count" column in the Mattermost.server\_daily\_details table. 

### Telemetry-Enabled Active Users

Telemetry-Enabled Active Users are users, hosted by a telemetry-enabled production server, that have visited the Mattermost site in the last 24 hours.

### TEDAU Caveats

TEDAU is the sum of active users for verified production servers that are telemetry-enabled \(described in [this TEDAS section](metrics-definitions.md#server-condsiderations)\). All other servers, and their active user counts, are ignored as they represent testing, dev, and one-off user case environments that skew the measure.
