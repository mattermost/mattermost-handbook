#### ARR \(Annual Recurring Revenue\)

* ARR is the value of the contracted recurring revenue of your term subscriptions normalized to a one-year period
* `ARR = (Total Contract Value / (End Date - Start Date)) * 365`
* [ARR Overview Dashboard](https://mattermost.looker.com/dashboards/14): Overview of Mattermost ARR
* ARR increases and decreases based on the following categories of change:
  * New: New Logo never seen before - Caused by a brand new and never before see Account signing a contract
  * Expansion: Increase in ARR by an Account - Caused by seat increase, price increase, or product upgrade
  * Contraction: Decrease in ARR by an Account - Caused by seat decrease, price decrease, or product downgrade
  * Churn: Decrease in ARR to $0 by an Account - Caused by an Account moving completely off of Mattermost

#### NPS \(WIP\)

* Net Promoter Score (NPS) measures customer experience and predicts business growth
* Respondents are grouped as follows:
  * Promoters (score 9-10) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others, fueling growth
  * Passives (score 7-8) are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings
  * Detractors (score 0-6) are unhappy customers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative word-of-mouth
* Net Promoter Score = % Promoters - % Detractors
  * NPS ranges from -100 (if every customer is a Detractor) to 100 (if every customer is a Promoter)
* Mattermost's NPS is based off of a 1-10 ranking provided from customers
  * If a customer provides a ranking more than once in a day, we take the last ranking of the day for NPS
