### ARR \(Annual Recurring Revenue\)

* ARR is the value of the contracted recurring revenue of your term subscriptions normalized to a one-year period
* `ARR = (Total Contract Value / (End Date - Start Date)) * 365`
* [ARR Overview Dashboard](https://mattermost.looker.com/dashboards/14): Overview of Mattermost ARR
* ARR increases and decreases based on the following categories of change:
  * New: New Logo never seen before - Caused by a brand new and never before see Account signing a contract
  * Expansion: Increase in ARR by an Account - Caused by seat increase, price increase, or product upgrade
  * Contraction: Decrease in ARR by an Account - Caused by seat decrease, price decrease, or product downgrade
  * Churn: Decrease in ARR to $0 by an Account - Caused by an Account moving completely off of Mattermost
* [ARR Monthly Net Changes](https://mattermost.looker.com/looks/2?toggle=det): Monthly ARR Net Changes broken down by the four categories above

### Net Promoter Score \(NPS\) \(WIP\)

* Net Promoter Score \(NPS\) measures customer experience and predicts business growth
* Respondents are grouped as follows:
  * Promoters \(score 9-10\) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others
  * Passives \(score 7-8\) are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable
  * Detractors \(score 0-6\) are unhappy customers who can damage your brand
* Net Promoter Score = % Promoters - % Detractors
  * NPS ranges from -100 \(every customer is a Detractor\) to 100 \(every customer is a Promoter\)
* Mattermost's NPS is based off of a 1-10 ranking provided by customers
  * If customers provide rankings 2+ times in a day, the last ranking of the day is used for NPS
