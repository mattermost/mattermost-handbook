# V2MOM

Vision

* Business Operations exists to make all of the Mattermost functions wildly successful. We do this by providing the best possible People, Process and Systems.

Values

* **Customer Love**
    * BizOps exists to serve our customers, both internally and externally. To do this, we must focus on stellar customer service. 
    * Everything we do is a product. We make sure that anything we ship is thorough, easy to use and documented. We pride ourselves on established customer SLAs and our ability to meet them consistently.
* **Trust**
    * We are the Trusted Advisor. We strive to stay “function-neutral”, doing what is best for the company, not one particular group or person.
    * We are passionate about securing all of our data. Security compliance (GDPR, etc.) is not an option and we will strive daily to achieve that goal.
    * We are transparent and open about what we can do and what we can’t. If we miss a deliverable in scope or deadline, we own it and work to ensure that never happens again. 
    
* **Ruthless Efficiency**
    * We will automate tasks wherever possible, even if it means that it takes longer to get something done up front. 
    * If a meeting can be 30 mins then it won’t be an hour. 
    * We project manage to great detail, which keeps us on track and minimizes scope-creep and project slip.


Methods

* Project Management:  Define, scope, prioritize and implement the right things in Q4 and beyond.
* Customer Journey operations and instrumentation: Define the Customer Journey with functional stakeholders. Build a project timeline to implement process and tooling to support all key CJ milestones. In the short term we will focus on Customer Billings, License and Provisioning \(BLP\)
* Establish a data and analytics service bureau: Create data and analytics infrastructure that will be used to manage all company critical data. Work with stakeholders to document canonical definitions of key metrics. Establish a self service model for end users. A short term priority will be to begin working centralizing Product Data and Telemetry
* MLT Vision and buy-in: Work with MLT to define and scope key MLT metrics and project milestones
* IT systems operations:  Focus on creating a catalog of all systems used at Mattermost. Identify contract details, spend, owner and users with access. Sunset systems no longer used and/or performing a duplicate function.

Obstacles

* It will take time to fully understand all the needs of the company and prioritize appropriately.
* Lack of common business and technical definitions for key company and functional metrics
* Resources available to tackle key projects
* Lack of central control and standardization of systems. There are a few instances where there is more than 1 system performing the same function.

Measures

* TBD within Q4
* Will be based on project milestones around abopve methods
