# Performance Reviews - 50%

### What is the purpose of a performance review? 

 ****Performance reviews occur annually during the last two months of the calendar year.  Every component of the review process reflects the following priorities

* **Increase output** - Empower staff to unlock their potential by identifying and addressing their two most significant opportunities to increase performance.
* **Recognize Performance** - Provide a clear, fact-based recognition of a staff member's performance.
* **Calibrate** - Provide a periodic opportunity for calibrating of level and/or local market compensation using a consistent, company-wide system.
* **Reflect Core Values** - align performance metrics to [Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles). 

### **High Output Management** 

We believe a manager’s fundamental purpose of a performance review is to improve performance. Andy Grove discusses this in Chapter 13 of his book, [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK). There are two [mindsets](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets) from the book that should be considered whether you are writing a peer, manager or self review. If you are a manager, you should read this chapter and attend one of the manager training sessions. 

* **Three Ls: Level, Listen, Leave yourself out** 

  * Level - be straightforward in praise as well as criticism. 
  * Listen -  be confident that your feedback is heard and understood, listen to the response. 
  * Leave yourself out - the review is not about you. Focus on the feedback you think is important in order for your direct report to increase future output. 

* **Output Measures vs. Internal Measures** 

  We value high output and high impact and this tip facilitates the right balance. Performance that is tangible and capable of being measured is a straightforward indicator of success. It may also indicate the activity was short-term oriented. Performance that takes place over a period of time may be long-term oriented and intended to increase output at a future date.

### **How is feedback shared?** 

Feedback is solicited in a 360-degree style to incorporate feedback from peers. If you manage people, your manager may include direct reports in your peer feedback panel.  

* **Peer Feedback** - Peer reviews are a personalized version of [Likes and Wishes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes). Staff will select 3-6 peers for their peer feedback panel. Managers can adjust the panel at any time prior to the deployment of peer surveys. We will try and limit peer review panel requests to 5 per person. 
* **Self Reflection** - [Self Awareness](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) is one of our [Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) and will be a factor of success for the entire process. This portion is written by self. 
* **Manager Evaluation** - Managers will review all feedback to complete your performance appraisal.

### **What is the process?** 

We are incorporating a 90d New Hire Feedback Survey that will greatly mimic this process. If you have recently joined, your manager may prefer to wait for the full 90 days for your review. Otherwise,  your review you will take part in a Formal or Informal review process.

* [Informal Review Process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/performance-reviews-50/informal-review-process)
  * Criteria: Staff members at Mattermost between 90 days and 6 months 
* [Formal Review ](https://app.gitbook.com/@mattermost/s/handbook/~/drafts/-LtWnmUAS1HU_gUGQnNT/operations/people/performance-reviews/formal-review-process)
  * Criteria: Staff members at Mattermost at least 6 months
