# Paid Time Off

Mattermost is a high performance, fast-paced startup where staff are empowered to do the best work of their careers. We love what we do and we love doing it from anywhere, working remotely and often blending our work and personal lives. 

In these ways, Mattermost can be "the Olympics" of your professional career, with the opportunity to grow and achieve far beyond anywhere you've worked before. 

At the same time, like star athletes, your growth and peak performance benefit greatly from the ability to interleave periods of exertion with periods of rest and reflection. 

Paid Time Off \("[PTO](../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto-or-paid-time-off)"\) is a process to help ensure our staff is effectively rotating their time around work, family, friends and all the things that matter most to them.

Note: If you are taking [Pregnancy](leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md) or [Parental Leave](leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md), please see [Leave Policies](leaves-of-absence/). 

## **Communicating Time Off**

### When you take time-off, please do the following:

1. Let your management know your [PTO](../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto-or-paid-time-off) dates and who will be your backup\(s\). 
2. Add your time off to [BambooHR ](https://mattermost.bamboohr.com/)
3. For meetings you’ll miss, message the chair with any status updates.
4. Post in the [Stand-up channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up) the dates you’ll be away and who’ll be your backup.
5. Block time in the [Mattermost Timeoff calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mattermost.com_mg3nulgf6e70e50ohlq2rrkcnc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles), so team can see who is away.

Note: Time off reminders appear in the [Stand-up channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up) on the first and last day of your PTO. 

There is no limit to how much time-off you can take when your work is meeting or exceeding expectations. We strongly recommend a minimum of 2 weeks per year.

## Holidays

Please take off holidays relevant to your culture, resident country and preferences. When doing so, please follow the time-off process in [Communicating Time Off](paid-time-off.md#communicating-time-off).

### Typical Canadian and U.S. Holidays

We’re headquartered in the US and have a large Canadian contingent, so below are holidays we’re expecting people from those countries to take off. These are not mandatory company holidays, just guidelines for people in specific country/regions.
