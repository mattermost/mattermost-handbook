# Paid Time Off

Mattermost is a high performance, fast-paced startup where staff are empowered to do the best work of their careers. We love what we do and we love doing it from anywhere, working remotely and often blending our work and personal lives.

In many ways, Mattermost can be "the Olympics" of our professional careers, with the opportunity to grow and achieve far beyond anywhere we've worked before.

At the same time, like star athletes, our growth and peak performance benefit greatly from the ability to interleave periods of exertion with periods of rest and reflection.

Paid Time Off \("[PTO](../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto-or-paid-time-off)"\) is a process to help ensure our staff develop a strong practice of **self-care** by effectively rotating their time around work, family, friends and all the things that matter most to them.

Note: If you are taking [Pregnancy](leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md) or [Parental Leave](leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md), please see [Leave Policies](leaves-of-absence/).

## **Communicating Time Off**

### When you take time-off, please do the following:

1. Let your management know your [PTO](../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto-or-paid-time-off) dates and who will be your backup\(s\). 
2. Add your time off to [BambooHR ](https://mattermost.bamboohr.com/)
3. With your Manager, ensure your team is [vacation-ready](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/working-at-mattermost#5-be-the-change-you-want-to-see) 

Note: PTO reminders appear in the [Stand-up channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up) on first and last day of PTO.

There is no limit to how much time-off you can take when your work is meeting or exceeding expectations. We strongly recommend a minimum of 2 weeks per year.

## Holidays

Please take off holidays relevant to your culture, resident [country/region](../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#country-region) and preferences. When doing so, please follow the time-off process in [Communicating Time Off](paid-time-off.md#communicating-time-off).
