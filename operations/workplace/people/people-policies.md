# Code of Conduct 

Mattermost is dedicated to fostering an inclusive workplace, and we prohibit harassment and discrimination of all staff and job applicants regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, veteran status, or other protected categories. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination and take violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.

Mattermost will ensure that all employment actions, including but not limited to recruitment, hiring, selection for training, promotion, transfer, demotion, layoff, recall, termination, rates of pay, or other forms of compensation, will be administered without regard to one’s protected class, including a disability or status as a protected veteran. Mattermost will also provide qualified applicants and employees with disabilities with needed reasonable accommodations, as required by law, and will ensure that all employment decisions are based only on valid job requirements.

Any employee or applicant who believes that they have been subject to harassment because of their protected status should promptly contact a manager in their chain of command, or promptly contact the Director of Human Resources at 650-667-8512 for assistance. Employees or applicants may also file a written complaint with the office of the Director of Human Resources, 530 Lytton Avenue, Second Floor, Palo Alto, 94301.

Training is provided annually on the identification and prevention of harassment based on disability and protected veteran status to all of Mattermost's employees.

To enable Managers and Supervisors with these responsibilities, Mattermost provides the following trainings.

### Electronic Monitoring Policy

Mattermost does not engage in electronic monitoring of staff or their activities through their work equipment, such as Mattermost-issued laptops or cell phones, work email, Mattermost, or other applications used by the company, except for legal, security, or compliance purposes. Any information collected will be used solely to help Mattermost meet its legal, security, or compliance requirements.

In the event of a workplace investigation, Mattermost may request access to staff activities on  Mattermost-issued systems or devices, where necessary.

### Health and Safety Policy

Creating a safe workplace is a shared responsibility between Mattermost and all staff. Mattermost is committed to promoting a safe work environment and supporting everyone in ensuring their home work environment is safe, and adheres to legislative requirements for healthy working conditions.

Mattermost’s Health & Safety policy outlines the procedures and guidelines for conducting health and safety assessments for all staff. It aims to:
* Prevent home office environment accidents and work-related ill health.
* Manage health and safety risks associated with remote work.
* Provide clear instructions, information, and adequate training on workplace health and safety.
* Promote health and safety best practices for remote work.
* Maintain safe and healthy working conditions.
* Review and revise Mattermost’s health and safety policy regularly.

**Home Office Setup**

As a remote-first company, staff are responsible for setting up their own home office. Mattermost provides [home office benefits](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#home-office-guidelines) and offers general guidelines to ensure that FT Staff have the equipment they need to do their work safely. Anyone requiring accommodations should reach out to the People Team.

While we do not prescribe a specific way for staff to set up their work area, the expectation is that everyone maintains a comfortable and safe work environment in a manner that reduces hazards and enhances productivity. This includes the use of ergonomic items such as appropriate desks, chairs, proper lighting, clear walkways, organized electrical cables, and suitable equipment to minimize the risk of workplace injuries. Here’s a [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13-48iC0fKJ17kEgqf798pp7lPGyHq_NzexgcKkSzFgI/edit?usp=sharing) on how to set up an ergonomic home office for maximum productivity and comfort. 

**Initial Assessment**

Prior to commencing work at Mattermost, FT staff will be asked to complete an initial health and safety self-assessment. The assessment will help staff to evaluate their home working environment, including workspace ergonomics, lighting, and any potential hazards.

**Health and Safety Responsibilities**

Building a safe workplace is a joint responsibility of all staff, managers, and Mattermost. The rights and responsibilities of all parties are outlined below.

The committee will hold regular meetings and initiate the quarterly workplace inspections conducted by staff members of their home office. Committee members include:

**Periodic Workplace Inspections** 

Workplace inspections are an important component of Mattermost’s Health and Safety Policy, aimed at identifying, evaluating, and mitigating potential health and safety hazards.

Staff are asked to inspect their workplaces quarterly using the Workplace Health and Safety Checklist, posted in the Workplace Health and Safety channel in Mattermost. The results of the inspection will help the JHSC evaluate potential risks, implement control measures, and develop appropriate training and resources to equip staff with the knowledge and skills to address potential risks.

All staff will be equally responsible for minimizing accidents within their workspaces. These responsibilities include but are not limited to working in compliance with local Health and Safety regulations, operating in compliance with Mattermost’s safe work policies and procedures, and using or following the measures put in place to maintain a healthy work environment.

**Training and Communication**

Mattermost will provide adequate health and safety training to staff where required including information about potential risks, and safe practices. Communications and updates about relevant health and safety topics, training, policies, procedures, and best practices will be shared in the Workplace Health and Safety channel in Mattermost.

**Reporting and Incident Management**

Staff must promptly report any health and safety incident to their managers, the People team, or the Joint Health and Safety Committee (JHSC). The People team and/or the JHSC will investigate and address reported incidents, take appropriate corrective actions, and implement preventive measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.

**Mental Health Support**

Mattermost understands that mental health is as crucial as physical health and we are committed to ensuring that our workplace promotes positive mental wellbeing of all staff. This includes maintaining a healthy work-life balance, developing a practice of self-care, and [disconnecting from work](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/mattermost-communication-best-practices#disconnecting-from-work).
