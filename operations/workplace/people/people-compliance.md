# Privacy Policies 

Our security and data privacy policies are located in the [Security Page - Policies section](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/security/policies). All staff members are required to onboard with Vanta, a software solution used to document policy acceptance and device security. Vanta also helps support our audit process, a compliance standard for our SOC2 certification.
