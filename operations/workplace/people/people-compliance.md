# Privacy Policies 

Our security and data privacy policies are located in the [Security Page - Policies section](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/security/policies). All staff members are required to onboard with Vanta, a software solution used to document policy acceptance and device security. Vanta also helps support our audit process, a compliance standard for our SOC2 certification.

To do this, please go to https://app.vanta.com/onboarding.

## Labor notices 

As a remote workplace, we don't have a physical office or breakroom where we can post labor or employment notices. This handbook page is our version of this.
