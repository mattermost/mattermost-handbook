# HR Systems

[Rippling](https://help.rippling.com/s/topic/0TO4o000000HsoAGAS/employee-resources) is our Human Resources Information System \(HRIS\).

The People Ops team uses Rippling to store staff information, records and important documents for HR reporting and analytics, and to organize new hire onboarding and offboarding workflows. Staff use Rippling to update their personal and emergency contact information, and to reference the organizational chart and staff directory.

## Updating Rippling

The People Ops team will update staff information as it relates to compensation changes, promotions or transfers, new hires, and terminations. For other changes, managers should initiate a change request in Rippling directly. Reach out to [HR](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people#team) if you have any questions.

## Shared Google Drive

When using Google Drive, always save documents to the appropriate shared drive. When handling confidential or sensitive data in Google Docs, ensure that access to the shared drive is limited to the staff with that data access.

## Confidential data in Google Docs

Functional Leads are responsible for creating clear guidelines on how teams and working groups should organize any internal docs that contain [confidential data](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/publishing/publishing-guidelines/confidentiality-guidelines). Teams that are required to handle confidential data should also have documented guidelines on data access based on role.

Staff are discouraged from using their Mattermost Google Drive to store personal information. As a part of [offboarding](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/offboarding), a Manager may request to transfer a departing team member's files to another staff member. No personal information will be requested via Google Docs from the Company.
