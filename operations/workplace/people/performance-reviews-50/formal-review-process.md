# Review Process for People Managers

This is the review process for the Mid-Year and Winter (formal) Performance Reviews. Note: calibration will differ between Mid-Year and Winter. See Timeline for detailed instructions.

## Confirm level expectations for roles are up to date

If any level descriptions need to be updated or written, Managers complete them before the review cycle begins.

## Manager training

Before each review cycle, Managers read the performance review chapter in High Output Management. Managers will be invited to attend [Manager Training on Performance Management at Mattermost](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50#manager-training) at the beginning of the [Annual Performance Review cycle](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50#what-is-the-process). If you don't have a copy, use [this form](https://forms.gle/SUWWvZZGqg5B4d1aA) to request a copy.

## Feedback panel requests

Managers will select peers in Culture Amp who can most effectively provide feedback on achievements and performance over the past year \(this can include upward feedback for people managers. Depending on the role, PT Staff and community members may be solicited to provide feedback in addition to the peer panel selected in Culture Amp\). Managers should log in to Culture Amp, go to **my team > request team feedback** and determine the peer panels for each direct report. More information for managers on selecting peer panels is available [here](https://academy.cultureamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003789699-Request-team-feedback). 

Prior to selecting peer panels and writing performance reviews for their direct reports, managers should take the Culture Amp training available [here](https://www.cultureamptraining.com/performance-for-managers).

## Peer feedback

Managers will select the peer panels in Culture Amp. To get started, log in to Culture Amp and navigate to your **task list** where you'll find requests for peer or upward feedback. On average, teammates should be completing feedback surveys for 3 - 6 of their peers.

## Self reflection

Full-time staff will receive an email via Culture Amp to complete their self-assessment. To get started, log in to Culture Amp and navigate to your **task list** where you'll find a request to complete your self-reflection. Once your self-reflection has been submitted, managers are able to make comments directly in your self-reflection document. Prior to writing their self-reflections, full-time staff should take the Culture Amp training available [here](https://www.cultureamptraining.com/participate-in-a-performance-cycle-for-employees).

## Performance Review

Once self-reviews and peer feedback have been completed, Managers will receive a notification from Culture Amp inviting them to write the performance reviews. Managers will read all feedback from the peer panel and self-assessment, and will incorporate their feedback based on their own performance expectations of this role.

When the review is complete, Managers will not share the reviews with their reports until calibration has been completed and any changes have been approved. HR will turn on "sharing" after all results have been finalized. Managers will then share the reviews with their direct reports accordingly.
*Note: It's helpful to share the review ahead of the 1:1 meeting to allow for time to read and digest feedback.*

## Calibration

All people Managers within the same [department](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#departments) or other group that the Team [MLT](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/mlt-cadence) indicates will participate in calibrations.

Managers will share their review expectation ratings (meets, exceeds, does not meet), any recommendations for a [level](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XNGYOHouoY42YYmFHNrhu-vHDtWVrPL5E8M_BpwF9iU/edit) change and/or a promotion, in the performance review for each of their reports. This recommendation is not shared with reports. HR will prepare calibration reports for each department/team and will share the report with the calibration group ahead of the meeting. During the meeting, Managers share feedback on any performance metric and apply [high standards](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles) in evaluation against the criteria for staff members' role and level.

## Compensation review and change memos

All compensation changes require approval of the VP of Finance & Operations and the CEO. CTO approval is required ahead of CEO approval for all Engineering compensation changes.

1. HR will review compensation data with each Team MLT 1:1, asynchronously.
2. HR, Team MLT, and required comp approvers meet to discuss, with email approval to follow and finalize with all attendees CC'd.
3. HR will send compensation change memos to each individual upon confirmation that the compensation news has been shared.

## Review discussion

Using your direct report's peer feedback and self assessment, deliver feedback with tangible and thoughtful feedback. This includes: accompolishments, areas of strength and opportunity for growth, and your evaluation of how your direct performance either meets, exceeds, or does not meet your expectations. If performance does not meet your expectations there will be a plan to improve performance, this may be informal or formal.
