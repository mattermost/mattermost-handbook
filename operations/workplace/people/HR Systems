### BambooHR

* [BambooHR](https://mattermost.bamboohr.com/home/) is our Human Resources Information System (HRIS). 
* The People Ops team uses BambooHR to store staff information, records and important documents for HR reporting and analytics, and to organize new hire onboarding and offboarding workflows.  
* Staff use BambooHR to update their personal and emergency contact information, and to reference the organizational chart and staff directory.

#### Updating BambooHR 

The People Ops team will update staff information as it relates to Compensation changes, promotions or transfers, new hires and terminations. For other changes, managers should initiate a change request in BambooHR directly. Reach out to [HR](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people#team) if you have any questions. 

**BambooHR fields that Managers can update** 
* Job title
* Department - this will be the internal team. For example, a Product Manager's Department is "R&D" and their team would be "Product Management."  
* Reports To - This field is typically updated as part of other processes, onboarding, offboarding, etc.  
* Location - See [People Manager Approvals](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/manager-onboarding-1#people-manager-approvals) ahead of requesting this change

### Google Shared Drive
When using Google Drive, always save documents to the appropriate shared drive. When handling confidential or sensitive data in Google Docs, 

#### Confidential Data in Google Docs
Functional Leads are responsible for creating clear guidelines on how teams and working groups should organize any internal docs that contain [confidential data](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/publishing/publishing-guidelines/confidentiality-guidelines). Teams that are required to handle confidential data should also have documented guidelines on data access based on role. 

Staff is discouraged from using their Mattermost Google Drive to store personal information. As a part of [offboarding](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/offboarding), a Manager may request to transfer a departing team member's files to another staff member. No personal information will be requested via GoogleDocs from the Company.
