# Staff Resource Groups (SRGs)

**What are Staff Resource Groups?** 

Mattermost’s Staff Resource Groups (SRGs) are communities of belonging based on staff shared experiences and/or identities. SRGs can help build more bridges that support connection, iteration and growth in how we use our product to collaborate and communicate. The purpose of the SRG is to create a space to facilitate discussions and elevate staff issues, seek to advance and foster a respectful and inclusive company culture, increase equity and visibility, and impact company programs and initiatives. All Staff Resource Group members are expected to support an inclusive environment by adhering to the conduct standards [link to conduct standards full text].

**Guiding Principles** 

1. **Cultivate Connection:** Foster safe spaces to build bridges with clear and simple processes that enable participation, and structured guidelines that support consistency with the Staff Resource Group Mission. 
2. **Growth through Purpose:** Establish a clear purpose for each Staff Resource  Group that demonstrates intent to continually seek ways to grow in our capabilities, staff community and business with a balance of near and long term priorities, and in alignment with our Leadership Principles. 
3. **Inclusive Iteration:** Embrace opportunities to expand our collective perspective by sharing learnings and feedback to continuously improve how our Company’s programs, processes, and policies support our global workplace.  

**Conduct Standards: How we operate with Inclusivity**  

- Practice behaviours of inclusion and allyship, such as self-awareness, empathy, curiosity, and humility. 
- Apply the Platinum Rule: Treat others the way they want to be treated. 
- Create an environment of belonging where every member of the group feels welcome, has a voice, and is treated with dignity and respect. 
- Be mindful of and update the language you use. Avoid slang and idioms that may not translate across cultures. 
- Encourage the representation of different perspectives. Give people the space to talk. 
- Embrace micro-affirmations: Be open minded and listen. Recognize, validate, and amplify others’ experiences, emotions, and voices.
- Tune into inequities and proactively confront micro-aggressions, conscious or unconscious biases. 
- Report inappropriate behaviour and comments that are vexatious, abusive, discriminatory, or unwelcome to your SRG Champion and HR. 

*SRG Champions are responsible for ensuring that SRGs operate with inclusivity and all members of your group abide by Mattermost’s Anti-Discrimination/Anti-Harassment Policy and the SRG Conduct Standards. Behaviour or language that is considered vexatious, abusive, discriminatory, or makes someone feel uncomfortable or unsafe at work must be reported to HR. This includes any physical, verbal, or non-verbal offensive behaviour or language that is directed at an individual because of their identity, including their sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, race/colour, ethnic origin/place of origin, language, creed, family status, disability, neurodiversity, or other identities. Refer to Mattermost’s Anti-Discrimination/Anti-Harassment Policy for more information.*
