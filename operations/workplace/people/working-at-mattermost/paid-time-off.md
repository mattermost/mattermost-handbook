# Paid Time Off

Mattermost is a high performance, fast-paced startup where staff are empowered to do the best work of their careers. We love what we do and we love doing it from anywhere, working remotely and often blending our work and personal lives.

In many ways, Mattermost can be "the Olympics" of our professional careers, with the opportunity to grow and achieve far beyond anywhere we've worked before.

At the same time, like star athletes, our growth and peak performance benefit greatly from the ability to interleave periods of exertion with periods of rest and reflection.

Paid Time Off \("[PTO](../../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto-or-paid-time-off)"\) is a process to help ensure our staff develop a strong practice of **self-care** by effectively rotating their time around work, family, friends and all the things that matter most to them.

Note: If you are taking [Pregnancy](leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md) or [Parental Leave](leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md), please see [Leave Policies](leaves-of-absence/).

## **Communicating Time Off**

### When you take time-off, please do the following:

1. Let your management know your [PTO](../../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto-or-paid-time-off) dates and who will be your [backup\(s\)](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/working-at-mattermost#5-be-the-change-you-want-to-see).
2. Post in the [Stand-up channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up)
3. Block off time in the shared [Mattermost Time Off calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mattermost.com_mg3nulgf6e70e50ohlq2rrkcnc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles>), so it's easy for the team to see who is going to be away.
4. Enjoy your time off!

**Common Time Off Questions**

1. **Is there really no limit?** There is no limit to how much time-off you can take when your work is meeting or exceeding expectations. We strongly recommend a minimum of 2 weeks per year. 
2. **Is PTO monitored?** Short answer: no. Longer answer: some Regions may require a statutory amount of PTO to be both accrued and tracked. Time off will be tracked \(i.e. reported on\) in BambooHR up to a Region's statutory limit. 
3. **I'm in a region that requires a statutory accrual, can I take more time off than?** Yes. Once an accrued balance reaches 0, staff can continue to take time off  as part of the Mattermost PTO plan.
4. **Why do we track it in BambooHR?** BambooHR helps to maintain asynchronous communication with as few steps as possible by posting time off to a Time Off calendar, the [Stand-Up Channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up)

## Holidays

Please take off holidays relevant to your culture, resident [country/region](../../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#country-region) and preferences. When doing so, please follow the time-off process in [Communicating Time Off](paid-time-off.md#communicating-time-off).

### Typical Canadian and U.S. Holidays

We’re headquartered in the US and have a large Canadian contingent, so below are holidays we’re expecting people from those countries to take off.
