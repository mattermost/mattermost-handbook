# Paid Time Off

Mattermost is a high performance, fast-paced startup where staff are empowered to do the best work of their careers. We love what we do and we love doing it from anywhere, working remotely and often blending our work and personal lives.

In many ways, Mattermost can be "the Olympics" of our professional careers, with the opportunity to grow and achieve far beyond anywhere we've worked before.

At the same time, like star athletes, our growth and peak performance benefit greatly from the ability to interleave periods of exertion with periods of rest and reflection.

Paid Time Off \("[PTO](../../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto-or-paid-time-off)"\) is a process to help ensure our staff develop a strong practice of **self-care** by effectively rotating their time around work, family, friends and all the things that matter most to them.

Note: If you are taking [Pregnancy](leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md) or [Parental Leave](leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md), please see [Leave Policies](leaves-of-absence/).

## Communicating Time Off

### When you take time off \(full days only\) please do the following:

1. Add your time off to the [Mattermost Time Away Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bWF0dGVybW9zdC5jb21fbWczbnVsZ2Y2ZTcwZTUwb2hscTJycmtjbmNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).
2. [Autodirect Mattermost message replies](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/account-settings.html#automatic-direct-message-replies) and set your [out-of-office email response](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/settings/account-settings.html#automatic-direct-message-replies). 
3. If you are located in Canada, Germany, or UK, we are required to track vacation up to the statutory amount. Any time off after that does not need to be recorded. [HR](mailto:hr@mattermost.com) will share an individual document tracker.
4. Enjoy your time off!

**Note:** The intent of the Time Away Calendar is to maintain asynchronous communication. Please use the calendar to note any full days that you may not be available. This may include conferences, meet-ups, and team off-sites.

### Common Time Off Questions

1. **Is there really no limit?** There is no limit to how much time off you can take when your work is meeting or exceeding expectations. We strongly recommend a minimum of 2 weeks per year.
2. **Is PTO monitored?** Short answer: no. Longer answer: some countries/regions may require a statutory amount of PTO to be both accrued and tracked. Time off will be tracked \(i.e. reported on\) in BambooHR up to a country/region's statutory limit.

## Holidays

Please take off holidays relevant to your culture, resident [country/region](../../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#country-region), and preferences. When doing so, please follow the time off process in [Communicating Time Off](paid-time-off.md#communicating-time-off).
