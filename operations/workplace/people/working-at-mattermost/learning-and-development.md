# Learning and development

## Purpose

Learning is a cornerstone of our culture and a core aspect of our "Self Awareness" Leadership Principle. We strive to provide opportunities for individual growth and career development by encouraging continuous learning and knowledge sharing.

## Guiding principles

1. **Inclusively enable:** People learn differently and in the context of learning enabling performance, we strive to design learning experiences and programs to support our global workforce.
2. **Cultural reinforcement:** Learning and Development programs should reinforce our Leadership Principles: Customer Obsession, Ownership, High Impact, Earn Trust, Self Awareness.
3. **Develop mastery:** Make the learnings impactful by choosing training that you’ll be able to practice at work. [The Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) shows how learned information slips out of memory unless action and care is taken to retain it. [The Learning Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_pyramid) shows that 90% of learned material is retained when you teach it to someone else. In other words, [Learn, Master, Teach](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#learn-master-teach).

## Learning programs 

**Manager 01** is a toolkit developed by the People Team to onboard new managers and equip them with the fundamental knowledge and resources they’ll need to be successful People Managers at Mattermost. The toolkit is designed to help new managers understand expectations including behaviors, shared values, programs, and processes. The toolkit is a living document and will continue to evolve over time. Managers are encouraged to share feedback and contribute to the learning and development of their peers.

**The Manager Core Skills Training Series** is developed by LifeLabs Learning and based on extensive research in psychology and organizational behavior. The training consists of 10 workshops and is designed to equip managers with the core skills and knowledge key to effective and inclusive leadership. 
- We offer LifeLabs Learning workshops to our Individual Contributors (ICs) to enhance important skills and competencies that complement the Manager Core Skills Training Series.
- Culture Amp’s Skills Coach delivers bite-size, daily, interactive online learnings that are based on LifeLabs’ Core Skills material. Managers and ICs can self-enroll in the micro-workshops directly in Culture Amp.

**GrowthSpace** Coaching is an impactful way for individuals to boost their performance and drive their growth and development. We’ve partnered with Growth Space to offer full-time staff an opportunity to engage with industry experts through a tailored coaching program. Participants will be matched with an experienced coach over five one-hour long sessions to develop, improve, or enhance key skills identified as targeted areas for growth. The focus areas will align with specific development goals participants set in combination with their manager.

## Bravely

Learning is a core part of our culture and we strive to emphasize deliberate development by creating different learning opportunities and experiences that help support our global, remote team. 

We’ve partnered with Bravely to offer full-time staff an opportunity to engage with industry experts through a tailored, on-demand coaching program. Coaching is an impactful way for individuals to drive their growth and development but it requires an investment of time and energy; it’s a benefit that's ideal for individuals who are open to change and feedback. 

All full-time staff are eligible for **two 45-minute** on-demand, coaching sessions in FY25. These personalized coaching sessions are intended to advance learning and growth, and provide meaningful support to staff to drive transformational change. Bravely users will also have access to exclusive monthly webinars on a variety of workplace skills topics, and a digital content library for self-directed development through the Bravely platform.

#### Use Cases

As a general guideline, coaching is an effective resource for the following use cases: 
- For targeted skill development, including improving performance and accelerating career growth
- For self-actualization, including improving confidence and overcoming imposter syndrome
- Following a promotion or starting a new role, including for new hires joining Mattermost
- For new managers and emerging leaders to develop and enhance their leadership capabilities
- To navigate organizational change
- To improve work relationships, including managing up, strengthening cross-team collaboration skills, and effectively managing conflict
- To tackle stress and burnout
- Returning to work after a leave of absence
- DEI coaching

#### How it Works

- All FT Staff will have access to Bravely’s platform. 
- Schedule your first session via the Bravely app. You will be matched with a certified and credentialed coach from Bravely’s global network.
- You will meet with your coach for a 45-minute, confidential coaching session (either video or phone).
- You can choose to meet with the same coach again or try another coach for your second session.
- The People Team will monitor program feedback to gain insights on staff needs and emerging themes. After completing your coaching sessions, please fill out this [feedback form](https://forms.gle/KuHCwo9TSaXhcVYE7) to evaluate the post-learning success of the initiative. Following each coaching session, Bravely will also prompt you to provide your anonymous session feedback. In both instances, your feedback is anonymous and is an important way for the People Team to understand program efficacy and utility.

If you would like to opt out of the coaching program, please contact the People Team so your coaching sessions can be re-allocated. Staff may be eligible for additional coaching sessions. If you have used your sessions and would like to request additional sessions, or if you are a manager with a team member who would benefit from additional coaching sessions, please reach out to your People Partner.
