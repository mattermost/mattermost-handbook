# Out of office email 

When writing an out of office (OOO) email response, the following recommendations help guide your coworkers on who they can contact in your absence:

* For every AOR, make it clear who to go to while you’re away.
* Include the full name of your “anything else” contact (your manager is the default). 
* If you’re completely away, everything goes to your “anything else” person. This is 100% fine. 
* If you plan to check-in while away for important issues, state how to reach you (e.g. text/phone, email with “URGENT”, etc.) 

# Out of office email template

Here is a sample out of office email template you can use as a starting point. Replace the text in **bold** with your details:

Hello, 
 
Thank you for your email, I'm currently 'out of office' and will return **DATE**. 
 
Please mark an email URGENT if something needs attention. Otherwise I'll aim to reply when I return.
 
In the interim, you can also contact:
 
**NAME (ROLE) - List AORS/things they should be contacted for**
 
For anything else, please contact: **Full Name/Manager**
 
Thank you!
