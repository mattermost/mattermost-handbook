# Out of office email 

When writing an [out of office (OOO) email response](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yu4pNey7BSjSG7eqEb6K4NDpmudOvGD7vbcdFyZegDg/edit?usp=sharing), the following recommendations help guide your coworkers on who they can contact in your absence:

* For every AOR, make it clear who to go to while you’re away.
* Include the full name of your “anything else” contact (your manager is the default). 
* If you’re completely away, everything goes to your “anything else” person. This is 100% fine. 
* If you plan to check-in while away for important issues, state how to reach you (e.g. text/phone, email with “URGENT”, etc.)
