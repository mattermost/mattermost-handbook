# Onboarding

Welcome to Mattermost Onboarding! The goal of the Onboarding program is to welcome and enable new colleagues into a safe and compliant working environment with a strong sense of belonging within their first 90 days at Mattermost.

Onboarding is an all-company partnership between a new colleague and Mattermost. Specifically this includes a new colleague’s manager, functional and working teams, onboarding [peers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQULEvgOhGeEGLTzdOlSvo858vo94zmnMN8sygi-lHk/edit?ts=5e21f202), [HR](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people#team) and MLT.

## Post-Onboarding Readiness

Post-Onboarding Readiness is an internal measure based on feedback throughout a new team member’s first 90 days at Mattermost. There are multiple milestones throughout the onboarding process where feedback is solicited. This feedback assesses how willing and enabled a new colleague is to bring their best self to Mattermost as it relates to their role expectations, team and company focuses, and the Mattermost Leadership Principles.

Feedback is requested from the new colleague's peers throughout the 90-day Onboarding. These consistent check-ins help new colleagues, People team, and managers iterate with impact quickly. For example, one of the [V2MOM - Destination Workplace Measures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDSaeW-M92gth_NM1vI23dtbFLBsYVIk/edit#slide=id.g6f2ea8cda4_8_1852) is to have fewer than 5% questions repeat month-over-month.

## Onboarding Feedback to Assess Post-Onboarding Readiness

### Onboarding Surveys

New staff will be invited to share feedback of their onboarding experience after 30 days of working at Mattermost. FT Staff will receive an invitation via email to complete the 30-Day Onboarding Survey in Culture Amp. Early feedback from new hires is a crucial way to gather insights about what is going well and what needs to be improved in the onboarding process. The feedback shared in the survey will help the People team identify key areas to focus on to continue making Mattermost a great place to work.

### New Staff Feedback Session with CEO and the People Team

Similar to [CEO listening tours](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#ceo-listening-tours) in this session, new colleagues are asked to share [likes and wishes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes) about anything related to Mattermost and the Onboarding Program. This session with the CEO is scheduled 2 months after the start date of new staff.

The People team will schedule a week 1 check-in with new staff. This check-in serves as an opportunity to address any unanswered questions the new staff members may have. It also allows for seeking clarification on the onboarding process if anything remains unclear. Additionally, the check-in aims to provide general guidance and support as needed during the initial stages of employment. 

### New Colleague Feedback

The 90-Day Feedback provides a [360](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50#how-is-feedback-shared) [shoulder check](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#shoulder-check) for new team members, managers, [HR](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people#team), and MLT to understand and clarify potential blindspots as well as catch potential [brown M&Ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms) early on.

This is not a formal performance review. The intent is to align expectations and improve performance early on. Peer feedback is not anonymous. Managers may need additional context from the panel to help increase the new colleague's performance and Post-Onboarding Readiness. Managers should keep peer feedback anonymous in the 90-Day Evaluation with the new colleague. Managers should also evaluate feedback based on their own expectations of the new colleague's role. In some cases, expectations may need to be reset with colleagues. Uncovering blindspots early on helps everyone avoid future confusion or misaligned efforts.

### New Colleague 90-Day Feedback Process

#### Managers

* You will receive an email during your direct report's third month at Mattermost asking you to select a peer panel in Culture Amp. This kicks off the [review process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50#how-is-feedback-shared).
* Log in to **Culture Amp &gt; Performance &gt; Inbox**. Designate the peer panel to provide feedback about your new staff member. For new hires who are also people managers, direct reports may also be included in the peer panel to provide upward feedback about their manager.
