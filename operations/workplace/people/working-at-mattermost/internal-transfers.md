# Internal Transfers

Internal transfers have an informal and formal component. Informally, a team member is encouraged to be curious and seek to learn about other roles, teams, projects, and Hiring Managers.

When a team member and Hiring Manager agree that a potential transfer may be a good fit, the Hiring Manager should discuss a potential transfer with the team member's current Manager as well as HR to kick off the formal transfer process.

Depending on the new role, there may be a need to assess skillset. This will be determined and communicated on a case-by-case basis.

The goal of this discussion is to:
- Confirm headcount requirement exists.
- Assess organizational impact (e.g. needs of team, product, and company).
- Check for performance blindspots.
- Address skillset transition (e.g. current level and experience within level and the new level, as well as any additional experience required for the role).
- Allow HR to confirm potential compensation impact, especially if the transition results in a decrease in compensation.
- Create a transition plan that balances the needs above with an aligned timeline.

### Typical Internal Interview Process

Hiring Managers and MLT will determine what the skillset assessment process will be for an internal promotion or transfer. The typical process here is intended to outline the various components of an internal transition. This process should also ocurr after the discussion topics listed above have taken place with approval from the Team MLT.

1. Hiring Manager and MLT should confirm that the new role need exists and confirm [any new headcount requests](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#how-to-open-a-new-role) that may be needed. Example: if a staff member is interviewing for a new role, the staff member's current role may require a backfill. This backfill headcount will need to be [approved as a new headcount request](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#how-to-open-a-new-role).
2. Hiring Manager to work with Recruiting to develop the [Role Description](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#role-description) and [interview panel focus areas](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#interview-process). The Role Description should be shared with the staff member and interview panel.
3. The Recruiter will set up the interview times for the staff member and the interview panel. Interviewers will be asked to [submit feedback & provide an interview rating](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#interview-panel-process) through Lever or through Mattermost.
4. The Recruiter will incorporate the [mid-interview sync](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#mid-interview-sync) with the interview feedback and share with the Hiring Manager, Team MLT and [AA](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#as-appropriate-interviews-aas) ahead of these interviews. Note: AA interviews may not be required and will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
5. Final interview decisions will determine the next steps.
  * If the Hiring Manager, Team MLT, and the staff member want to proceed with the transfer, the Hiring Manager and Team MLT will work with HR to determine compensation changes, transfer plan, timeline, and effective date.
    * HR or the Team MLT will communicate the compensation to the staff member and handle the required paperwork to document the change.
    * The Hiring Manager and staff member will also have a discussion to set expectations on [AORs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/areas-of-responsibility) - both new and transitioning.
  * If the Hiring Manager, Team MLT, or staff member decide to not proceed with the transfer, the Hiring Manager will communicate this to the staff member. As part of this communication, the Hiring Manager may suggest opportunities for mentorship and continued learning in specific areas as it relates to the role.  Your manager may suggest opportunities to level up your skillset, including a potential Mattermost Mentor, external courses, or assignment of new projects or tasks.
