# Internal Transfers

Internal transfers have an informal and formal component. Informally, a team member is encouraged to be curious and seek to learn about other roles, teams, projects, and Hiring Managers.

When a team member and Hiring Manager agree that a potential transfer may be a good fit, the Hiring Manager should discuss a potential transfer with the team member's current Manager as well as HR to kick off the formal transfer process.

Depending on the new role, there may be a need to assess skillset. This will be determined and communicated on a case-by-case basis.

The goal of this discussion is to:
- Confirm headcount requirement exists
- Assess organizational impact (e.g. needs of team, product, and company)
- Check for performance blindspots
- Address skillset transition (e.g. current level and experience within level and the new level, as well as any additional experience required for the role)
- Allow HR to confirm potential compensation impact, especially if the transition results in a decrease in compensation
- Create a transition plan that balances the needs above with an aligned timeline
