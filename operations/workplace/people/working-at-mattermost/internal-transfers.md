# Transfers and Promotions

We want staff to feel empowered to do the best work of their careers at Mattermost and enabled to drive the direction of their own growth trajectories at Mattermost.

## What's the difference between a transfer and a promotion?

* Transfers occur when a team member moves to a new team or function and owns a different set of [AORs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/areas-of-responsibility). For example, a Customer Support Engineer transferring to a Product Manager role.
* Promotions occur when a team member increases in level within the same team or function. For example, an SDE I being promoted to SDE II.

### Process for Transfers

Internal transfers have an informal and a formal component. 

Informally, a team member is encouraged to be curious and seek to learn about other roles, teams, projects, and Hiring Managers. Managers or MLT may also initiate a transfer conversation as part of general organization and team planing.

When a team member and Hiring Manager agree that a potential transfer may be a good fit, the Hiring Manager should discuss a potential transfer with the team member's current Manager as well as HR to kick off the formal transfer process.

Depending on the new role, there may be a need to assess skillset. This will be determined and communicated on a case-by-case basis.

The goal of this discussion is to:
- Confirm headcount requirement exists.
- Assess organizational impact (e.g. needs of team, product, and company).
- Check for performance blindspots.
- Address skillset transition (e.g. current level and experience within level and the new level, as well as any additional experience required for the role).
- Allow HR to confirm potential compensation impact, especially if the transition results in a decrease in compensation.
- Create a transition plan that balances the needs above with an aligned timeline.

### Process for Promotions

**Cadence**

Level changes are reviewed and discussed during every [performance review cycle](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50?q=levels). As such, promotions typically happen once a year during the [Winter Performance Review cycle](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50/performance-review-timeline-winter-2019). Managers and staff are also encouraged to discuss growth and development opportunities throughout the year.

**Off-Cycle Cadence**

Off-cycle promotions may also occur based on business need. This is typically determined if a [new job need exists](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#how-to-open-a-new-role). Staff members can express interest in being considered for an [open role](https://mattermost.com/careers/) by reaching out to the Hiring Manager. Similar to transfers, depending on the new role, there may be a need to assess skillset. This will be determined and communicated on a case-by-case basis, and will typically involve components of the internal interview process.

**Manager and Above Promotions**

Managers are responsible for ensuring alignment across the org and within their own team. Managers play a significant role in their teams and direct report's careers at Mattermost. It's important that every newly hired or promoted manager fully understands the role and responsibilities of Managers at Mattermost, and that they're set up for success to meet or exceed future role expectations. We assess every management level based on the [Mattermost Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles).

* Promotions to Manager will typically follow the typical internal interview process.  
* Promotions to Director will typically include interviews with the CEO and CTO. 

### Typical Internal Interview Process

Hiring Managers and MLT will determine what the skillset assessment process will be for an internal promotion or transfer. The typical process here is intended to outline the various components of an internal transition. This process should also occur after the discussion topics listed above have taken place with approval from the Team MLT.

1. Hiring Manager and MLT should confirm that the new role need exists and confirm [any new headcount requests](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#how-to-open-a-new-role) that may be needed. Example: if a staff member is interviewing for a new role, the staff member's current role may require a backfill. This backfill headcount will need to be [approved as a new headcount request](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#how-to-open-a-new-role).
2. Hiring Manager to work with Recruiting to develop the [Role Description](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#role-description) and [interview panel focus areas](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#interview-process). The Role Description should be shared with the staff member and interview panel.
3. The Recruiter will set up the interview times for the staff member and the interview panel. Interviewers will be asked to [submit feedback & provide an interview rating](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#interview-panel-process) through Lever or through Mattermost.
4. The Recruiter will incorporate the [mid-interview sync](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#mid-interview-sync) with the interview feedback and share with the Hiring Manager, Team MLT and [AA](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#as-appropriate-interviews-aas) ahead of these interviews. Note: AA interviews may not be required and will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
5. Final interview decisions will determine the next steps.
  * If the Hiring Manager, Team MLT, and the staff member want to proceed with the transfer, the Hiring Manager and Team MLT will work with HR to determine compensation changes, transfer plan, timeline, and effective date.
    * HR or the Team MLT will communicate the compensation to the staff member and handle the required paperwork to document the change.
    * The Hiring Manager and staff member will also have a discussion to set expectations on [AORs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/areas-of-responsibility) - both new and transitioning.
  * If the Hiring Manager, Team MLT, or staff member decide to not proceed with the transfer, the Hiring Manager will communicate this to the staff member. As part of this communication, the Hiring Manager may suggest opportunities for mentorship and continued learning in specific areas as it relates to the role.  Your manager may suggest opportunities to level up your skillset, including a potential Mattermost Mentor, external courses, or assignment of new projects or tasks.
  
### Mattermost Leadership Mentors

Mattermost Leadership Mentors is an informal, voluntary, and customizable program and method of [Learning, Mastering, and Teaching](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#learn-master-teach) at Mattermost. Mentors help guide and enable the development of a Mentee's behaviors, skillsets and/or mindsets. Mentees should bring a willingness and eagerness for their own development, and be ready to invest time in the Mentor-Mentee partnership.

### Side Projects

Staff are permitted to engage in side projects as long as the side project doesn't pose a conflict of interest with Mattermost projects and doesn't interfere with Mattermost work (e.g., doesn't involve the development of any technologies, infrastructure, or other material information that could be similar to Mattermost's business).

Before engaging in a side project, staff need to obtain written approval from Mattermost. To request approval, staff should email a request to hr@mattermost.com and their Manager. In the request, include a brief summary of the nature of your side project. The summary should include: 

* Expected time commitment.
* Description of services provided.
* Whether or not this work will be paid.
