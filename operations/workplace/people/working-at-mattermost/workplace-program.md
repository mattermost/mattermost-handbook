# Workplace Program

To foster friendships and stronger relationships within and across departments, Mattermost promotes several opportunities for staff members to connect with others across the organization.

## Social Activities

Mattermost team members organize the following activities and everyone is welcome to join!

### Coffee Time

Grab a \(remote\) coffee or tea, and socialize with a Mattermost team member for 30 minutes!

[Sign up for coffee time](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MoHM7tI61F0gFMigcwaSYOBCKxvJAAiAVaefHWM8wBQ/edit#gid=0) and you will randomly be paired up with another team member for coffee time, twice a month.

This activity is managed by People Team.

### Yoga Session

If you'd like to give your mind and body a quick break during your busy day sign up for a yoga session!

Check out dates and times for yoga sessions in the Social channel: [https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/social](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/social).

This activity is managed by People Team.

### Video Game Hour

## Celebration and Sympathy Gifts

At Mattermost, we like to share celebrations of life milestones and sympathy with our team members!

If you know a Mattermost team member who is either:

* Celebrating a special milestone such as wedding engagements, weddings, and childbirth; or
* Undergoing a major life event such as the passing of a family member/significant other, or is injured, ill, or hospitalized

Remember them with a gift to show you have them in your mind. You can request to send a celebration or sympathy gift to a team member by completing the [Celebration and Sympathy Gifts Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_ltFCvZhItVNWS6JV-glOnk1aU-d9oOfUZrW3zEiWhg/edit).

**Notes:**

* Multiple requests for the same event are combined into a single gift.
* All gifts will be sent to the address on file on their BambooHR profile.
* Before submitting a request, please confirm with the team member that their shipping address and phone number is currently up to date on their BambooHR profile, and ask them to update it if it is not current.
* Note that if someone is hospitalized, we send the sympathy gift to the hospital if we know the location.
* Any Mattermost team member can request on the Celebration and Sympathy Gifts Request form.
* Popular vendors we use are Harry and Davids, Amazon and international gift basket websites.
