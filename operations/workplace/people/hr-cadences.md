This Section outlines HR Cadences for company wide operations. 

### Listening Sessions 

Listening sessions are 1x1 meeting with your HR partner. The intent of the HR Listening Session is to connect with each team member 1x1 for a general pulse check at the org, team and individual level. All feedback is welcome, and the conversation may often center around [likes and wishes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes).

**Why listening sessions?**
1x1 listening sessions offer an opportunity to share feedback that some may not feel comfortable sharing in a group or public setting. Similarly, it's also a chance to share context that may help uncover [blindspots or brown m&ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#shoulder-check). The idea is to gather general themes as it varies across teams. Feedback will be kept confidential, unless otherwise requested or agreed upon by or with the staff member. Note: there may be topics that HR is legally required to act on (e.g. bullying, harassment). 

Feedback themes will help drive HR priorities, communication and/or clarification efforts and even coaching opportunities for managers and leaders. 

**Cadence**
Your HR partner will schedule time with you via Google Calendar. The goal is to meet with every person at least once per quarter. This may change due to HR team bandwidth. However, every staff member is encouraged to schedule time with someone on HR if there is not an existing scheduled meeting or if there’s an urgent topic. 

Manager listening sessions will happen once a month. In addition to the above topics, this is also an opportunity for people managers to unpack questions around people management challenges, concerns and/or best practices. This feedback will also help drive future Manager Training topics.

### Staff Enablement Survey

Information on [Staff Enablement Cadence](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#staff-enablement-survey) can be found here. 

#### Post-COM Survey Analysis

After the survey analysis is presented at [COM](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-com), HR will share Enablement Results with MLT as long as there are at least 5 submitted responses. The minimum response is 5 in order to preserve the anonymous nature of the survey. HR will work with MLT or the Team Lead to focus on relevant and actionable results based on the feedback. Next, MLT or Team Leads will share and discuss any next steps with the team.
