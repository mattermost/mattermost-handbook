## Important Notes

* **DO NOT share confidential HR information in the Mattermost pre-release server** \(a.k.a. [http://community.mattermost.com\](http://community.mattermost.com%29\) as it runs pre-production releases of Mattermost software and occasionally requires debugging of data stores. Use [BambooHR](https://mattermost.bamboohr.com/) to handle passport information, ID numbers and other sensitive data. HR issues \(e.g. health, extenuating circumstances, etc.\) should be discussed in @mattermost.com emails only.
