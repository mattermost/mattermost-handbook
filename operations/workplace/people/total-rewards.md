# Total Rewards

## Total Rewards Strategy

Our goal is to have a total rewards strategy that enables us to achieve the following:

1. Attract our ideal candidates (best cultural fit and the best fit for the role).
2. Align with local market compensation by paying similar compensation to comparably sized organizations in each local market.
3. Support growth and retention by adopting a longer term view of reward and recognition.

## Total Rewards Principles 

At Mattermost, decisions on compensation are guided by these three principles:

1. Data driven (pay decisions based on external and internal benchmarks).
2. Consistency (pay decisions guided by defined compensation frameworks to drive pay equity).
3. Clarity (decisions that clearly align with our total rewards strategy).

To learn more about how the total rewards guiding principles drive equitable and consistent compensation decisions, as well as how we approach compensation, please refer to the resources listed below:

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if my candidate's current compensation and/or expected compensation is materially higher than the recommendation from our Total Rewards System?**

The candidate is unlikely to be a fit for our company. Other candidates in the recruiting pool should be prioritized.

**What if I disagree with the compensation recommendation from our Total Rewards System?**

Any disagreement should be resolved within approximately 3 business days. If you disagree with our Total Rewards approach and the answers within this frequently asked questions page, please work with your MLT leader to share your viewpoint in writing with our Total Rewards Manager including, a) whether you disagree with one or more of our principles (being data driven, being consistent, and/or clearly aligning decisions with our model), b) list any data points you feel should be considered, c) share any other context on the disagreement.
 
If the disagreement can’t be resolved in approximately one business day with our Total Rewards Manager, please escalate to our Head of HR with your point of view in writing, followed by a meeting with you, our Total Rewards Manager and our Head of HR.
 
If the disagreement with our Head of HR cannot be resolved in 1 business day, please escalate to our CEO with your point of view in writing, which will be followed by a conversation with you and our HR leader and CEO will make the final decision.

**How do we know if our Total Rewards Strategy is correct?**

Aesthetically our Total Rewards Strategy should be at market rates for similar roles, levels and caliber at similar companies and similar local markets. In sampling compensation ranges we should see about half the sample at or below our range, and half the sample above our range.

**I know of a company that pays more for the same role in the same city; can we change our Total Rewards Strategy to match that data point?**

No. We expect to pay market rates. For the same type of role, level and geography in a similar type of company we expect half the market to be paying at or below our compensation bands and the other half above our compensation bands. To change our Total Rewards calibration we would need to see a balanced sample of data points and incorporate the data with the multiple compensation survey data sources we subscribe to.

**How does our Total Rewards system account for inflation?**

We account for inflation through analysis of changes in local market compensation by role and level. We use local market compensation as a benchmark incorporating the other inflationary benchmarks (energy, housing, etc.) impacting our staff members. In recommending a compensation change, the total rewards system considers external competitiveness, i.e. local market rates for similar roles at comparably sized organizations; market salary movements, i.e. salary increases at similar companies; internal pay equity; individual performance; and the staff member’s experience within the grade level, i.e. whether they are at the beginning of the learning curve or at the expert level for the role.

**How frequently should a staff member’s compensation be reviewed?**

Compensation reviews occur once a year as part of the end of year review cycle or as part of the mid-year review cycle if the criteria for [cycle 1](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/performance-reviews-50/midyear-performance-review-timeline-2020) reviews are met. There are instances where a manager may want to request for off-cycle compensation reviews, e.g. due to an unforeseen issue or due to a gap in planning. Off-cycle review requests are exceptions and would ideally only occur to address an urgent business need that cannot wait until the next performance review cycle. When an off-cycle review is requested, the HR team, CEO and company co-founders review the cause of the change and may conduct a post-mortem discussion and next actions to avoid off-cycle exceptions in future and present a summary to the compensation committee at the next Mattermost Board meeting in the context of pay equity governance during its closed session.

**Why do we differentiate compensation based on location?**

Alignment to local market compensation is a part of our total rewards philosophy as it allows the company to offer compensation that is competitive in each market. As an illustration, if Mattermost had office locations in different countries, then it would be reasonable to expect that the staff members in each location are paid similar salaries as other comparable employers in that location. Local market compensation also enables the company to offer an equitable standard of living for all staff. For example, if a staff member in California was paid the same salary as a staff member in Spain, the staff in California may fall under a lower standard of living bracket, while the staff member in Spain may fall under a higher standard of living bracket, relative to their respective local markets and the corresponding prices of goods and services.

**What’s the right way to think about our Total Rewards system in meeting my managerial goals?**

Total Rewards is taking an integrated view of a staff member’s conceptual and concrete benefits. In working with the Total Rewards team, managers should have a “Total Rewards view” from their direct report’s perspective on the overall benefits of working in their role at Mattermost versus at other organizations.

Conceptual benefits are about impact (the ability to make a difference, to influence decisions, to change the trajectory of our business and results), growth (the ability to learn, master and teach, to take on a broader scope, to learn from colleagues and rotate responsibilities), and connection (building lifelong relationships inside and outside the company in the context of our work and mission).
 
Concrete benefits include short term compensation (cash compensation, GTM variable bonuses, special recognition bonuses), long term compensation (company equity), benefits (including health insurance and other benefits or subsidies depending on region or country), and “something special” (training, development experiences, mentorship, etc.)
