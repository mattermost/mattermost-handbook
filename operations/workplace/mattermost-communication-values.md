# Overview

Mattermost is a high performance, all-remote, and high trust company. We believe that team is everything and enabling each team member to do the best work of their careers will enable Mattermost to continue to do our best work as a team. With Staff across the [globe](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1mENESkTtAsbfuah6KtRoBLwIjqqJ7Nzv&ll=19.358313530029793%2C-1.00877724999998&z=2), asynchronous and respectful communication is vital and the responsibility of every team member.

## Mattermost Communication Values

As an open source, remote-first and communities-centered company, effective, efficient and courteous communication is expected of every team member. A few guidelines we live by:  

* Model behavior aligned with our [Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-onboarding-guide#leadership-principles).
* Asynchronously communicate and default to [open actions](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#open-actions) unless confidentiality is required. Empower and enable your teammates with access and updates to information. 
* [Communities-Centered](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#companyhttps://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#company) means we define our success in terms of our [community](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/contributors/community#mattermost-community). 
 * We prioritize decisions to optimize value in order of: Customers, Company, Team, Self. This doesn't mean that individuals come last; rather, when done right, the expectation is that putting the Customer first will take care of the Company, Team and Self. The [Correct Minimums](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#correct-minimums-medic-field-surgeon-plastic-surgeon) mindset offers a good example of how we prioritize [Customer Obsession](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles).
* Communicate and write inclusively. Use simple language and avoid buzzwords and cultural idioms.
* Assume positive intent. If issues arise, constructive feedback or an [unscheduled post-mortem](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-do-a-post-escalation-post-mortem) is encouraged.
* Be mindful of your audience. Abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/mattercon/mattermost-code-of-conduct).

## Meeting Etiquette

Inspired by Corey Hulen's blog article of [6 Annoying Things People Do During Video Conferencing](http://hulen.com/video-conf-peevs/).

1. Avoid responding to messages in chat while on a meeting.
 * It can be distracting when someone tries to covertly respond to a message. First, other people on the call may hear your keyboard and notice you’re looking somewhere else. Second, if they are in the same channel as you, they can see the message **[User] is typing...** in Mattermost.
 * **Tip:** If you feel the need to respond immediately and are easily distracted, set yourself to “Do Not Disturb” mode while in meetings.
2. Avoid answering calls or checking text messages on your cell phone.
 * **Tip:** Put your phone on silent and place it out of arm’s reach, face down, so you don’t feel compelled to act.
3. Display your video on a monitor with your camera.
 * If you have your video display on a second monitor, it may cause you to look away from the camera, not looking at the camera when talking. It almost feels like you’re talking to someone else in the room behind your computer monitor.
 * **Tip:** Either move your camera, or move your video window so they are somewhat inline. Also remember to look towards the camera.
4. Mute audio in large video conferences when not speaking.
  * When not muted, others can hear random noises, like a fan running or a loud click-clack keyboard, which can be distracting.
  * **Tip:** Set your Zoom meetings to be on mute by default via Zoom settings.
5. Avoid fidgeting uncontrollably or spinning in your office chair.
  * **Tip:** If you’re in a group meeting and not doing much talking, feel free to stop your video.
6. Avoid connecting with your computer but also dialing in via cell phone.
  * If you connect with your computer and dial in, there are two of you in the meeting and the voice/video aren't synced when you talk. In large groups, there will be a random cell phone number that no one will know who they are.
  * **Tip:** If you have a bad internet connection and have to dial in, exit the Zoom meeting on your computer.
7. When presenting, increase window zoom size or set Powerpoint slides to presenter mode.
  * Otherwise, the text on screen may be too hard for others to see.

## Meeting Elements

Here we summarize meeting elements that can be re-used for meetings across teams.

### Ice-breaker

* 2 - 3 minute exercises designed to learn more about colleagues at the start of a recurring meeting.
* Typically rotates in random order with names pulled. As an example, the [R&D Meeting Ice-breaker List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dCgKFdYkaDYd7yzgbK2VcqscZ1Ni5uNnnkZZv63XtOg/edit#gid=0) rotates three colleagues per meeting (2 R&D staff, 1 ‘other’ (e.g. Sales, Ops, etc).

Examples:
 * “Hobby talk” - Sharing about an interesting hobby, past or present.
 * “My home town” - Sharing something interesting about where you grew up.
 * “Two truths and a lie” - Share two true facts about yourself and one lie, team guesses which is the lie.
 * “Questions” - e.g. “What would constitute a “perfect” day for you?”
 * Need further inspiration? Take a look [here](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/the-25-most-popular-icebreaker-questions-based-on-four-years-of-data-893df9b27531).

### Blindspots, Inspiration, Knowledge Share

* Exercise to find blindspots in team thinking at the end of a meeting.
* Items for team discussion can also be queued in this section.
* Colleagues share areas of concern and ask questions which invariably disclose blindspots or are an opportunity to improve communication.

Examples of questions:
 * “What’s the status on X?” // Often an important item that got forgotten.
 * “Who owns X?” // Reveals need for more clarity or communication.
 * “Why do we do X?” // Lets us verify if a process is needed, and if we’re handling it the right way.
