Once you're directed to the pending vendor invoice, please review the following details:

1. **Vendor:** Please make sure you are reviewing an invoice for the vendor that you have submitted a PO for.
2. **Amount:** Make sure the amount on the vendor invoice matches the submitted purchase order.
3. **Department:** Make sure this spend is for your department (or is properly allocated to your department in cases where the spend is shared with other departments).
4. **Description:** Make sure the description on the invoice is accurate. For example, a description of the service performed by the vendor for Mattermost.
