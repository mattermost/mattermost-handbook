Select the **Vendor** module to see the list of vendors that Mattermost purchases from. 
- To search for a vendor, enter the name of the vendor in the **Vendor** text box. 
- To display more vendor details, select the green plus sign to the far right of the screen to see available column options. From here, select the columns to display on the grid, such as **Id**, **Acct Mgr**, and **Terms**.

In the **Credit memos** module, you will also be able to see any credit memos that would need to be applied to an invoice. This would probably not happen too often.

In the **Payments** module, you'll see the payment status of your invoices.

For now, you won't need to access the **Accruals** or **Corporate Cards** modules.
