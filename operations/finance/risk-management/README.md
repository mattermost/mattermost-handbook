* Level 4 - Risk to address from 6 months from discovery
* Level 5 - Risk to address ASAP
* Level N - Needs Investigation

## Risk Types

* Intellectual property - including copyright
* Tax - including corporate tax, employment tax, sales tax, and other forms
* Liability - including risk from lack of/commitment to indemnity from/to 3rd parties
* Jurisdiction - including material risk from mechanisms other than JAMS or California law
* Export compliance - including U.S. embargo
* Employment law risk - including statutory benefits

## Agreements

Risk levels are most commonly addressed in agreements of the following types:

* Customer agreements
* Vendor agreements
* Employment agreements
* Partnerships agreements

### Mattermost Templated Agreement

Mattermost Templated Agreements \(MTAs\) have significant reduced risk and in general can be reviewed and executed within 1 business day.

Examples include:

* Mattermost Mutual Non-disclosure Agreement \(link needed\)
* [Mattermost U.S. Consulting Agreement](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/risk-management/mattermost-templated-agreements#mattermost-u-s-consulting-agreements)

### Custom Agreements

All custom agreements require approval by procurement and may take days to weeks to complete depending on their complexity.

#### Risk Types and Risk Levels for Custom Agreements

**Note:** Risk levels are expected to change over time. For example: Contracts in foreign jurisdictions may be less of an issue over time as we establish infrastructure in those jurisdictions.

| Risk Type | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Jurisdiction | U.S. jurisdiction outside of California in combination with potential for $100K+ in uninsured liability | Canadian or U.K. jurisdiction in combination with potential for $100K+ in uninsured liability    | Non-English-speaking, non-U.S. jurisdiction in combination with potential for $100K+ in uninsured liability  | Jurisdiction in a restricted list region/country, e.g. U.S. embargoed countries. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SIGN |

## Risk Acceptance Process

The following summarizes the process for review and risk acceptance on any agreement that binds Mattermost, Inc.

### Legal Review and Approval \("LRA"\)

This step is not required for [MTAs](./#mattermost-templated-agreement), only custom agreements.
  
Legal review and approval is required for all custom agreements and department heads should ensure their teams plan their work to provide at least 1-2 weeks for the review of any custom contracts.

If a department head anticipates more than 3-5 custom contracts of similar types \(e.g. advertising purchase agreements\), they should inform procurement in advance to create an [MTA](./#mattermost-templated-agreement) to speed contract execution.

### Risk Acceptance \("RA"\)

Risk Acceptance Initial \("RAI"\) is provided by a Mattermost staff member who is a non-interim department head or someone director-level or higher and who has also completed Mattermost procurement and risk management training within the last 12 months.

RAI initial should appear within 2 inches of the FCA signature it maximize clarity that RAI is complete when FCA is executed.

### Final Company Approval \("FCA"\)

To bind the company to any agreement Final Company Approval \("FCA"\) is provided by the company CEO, and potentially board members, via physical or electronic signature.

### E-sign Process

#### HR-related E-sign

All HR-related e-sign should be conducted via either:

* a HelloSign account controlled by Mattermost \(which is only accessible by staff approved for handling confidential HR data\)
* an e-sign system controlled by our partner law firm, Cooley

HR-related agreements should not be executed using the company-controlled DocuSign account given HR privacy requirements.

| Agreement | Risk Types | Risk Acceptance \(Initial\) | Final Company Approval \(Signature\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| U.S. W-2 Employee MTA | [IP, tax, liability, export compliance](./#risk-types) | DirHR or VPF | CEO |

#### General Agreements

The following table summarizes general agreements to be completed via company-controlled DocuSign or vendor-controlled DocuSign with written sign-off from Mattermost staff member requesting the agreement that the vendor will send the fully-executed contract to procurement within 1 business day after execution.

| Agreement  | Risk Types | Risk Acceptance \(Initial\) | Final Company Approval \(Signature\) |
