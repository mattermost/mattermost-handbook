### Mattermost Templated Agreement 

Mattermost Templated Agreements \(MTAs\) have significant reduced risk and in general can be reviewed and executed within 1 business day. 

Examples include: 

* Mattermost Mutual Non-disclosure Agreement \(link needed\)
* Mattermost U.S. Consulting Agreement  

### Custom Agreements

All custom agreements require approval by procurement and may take days to weeks to complete depending on their complexity. 

#### Risk Types and Risk Levels for Custom Agreements 

Note: Risk levels are expected to change over time. For example: Contracts in foreign jurisdictions may be less of an issue over time as we establish infrastructure in those jurisdictions. 

| Risk Type | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Jurisdiction | U.S. jurisdiction outside of California in combination with potential for $100K+ in uninsured liability | Canadian or U.K. jurisdiction in combination with potential for $100K+ in uninsured liability    | Non-English-speaking, non-U.S. jurisdiction in combination with potential for $100K+ in uninsured liability  | Jurisdiction in a restricted list region/country, e.g. U.S. embargoed countries. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SIGN |

## Risk Acceptance Process 

The following summarizes the process for review and risk acceptance on any agreement that binds Mattermost, Inc. 

### Legal Review and Approval \("LRA"\) 

This step is not required for [MTAs](./#mattermost-templated-agreement), only custom agreements.  
  
Legal review and approval is required for all custom agreements and department heads should ensure their teams plan their work to provide at least 1-2 week for the review of any custom contracts. 

If a department head anticipates more than 3-5 custom contracts of similar types \(e.g. advertising purchase agreements\), they should inform procurement in advance to create an [MTA](./#mattermost-templated-agreement) to speed contract execution. 

### Risk Acceptance \("RA"\) 

Risk Acceptance Initial \("RAI"\) is provided by a Mattermost staff member who is a non-interim department head or someone director-level or higher and who has also completed Mattermost procurement and risk management training within the last 12 months. 

RAI initial should appear within 2 inches of the FCA signature it maximize clarity that RAI is complete when FCA is executed. 

### Final Company Approval \("FCA"\) 

To bind the company to any agreement Final Company Approval \("FCA"\) is provided by the company CEO, and potentially board members, via physical or electronic signature.

### E-sign Process 

#### HR-related E-sign

All HR-related e-sign should be conducted via either: 

* a HelloSign account controlled by Mattermost \(which is only accessible by staff approved for handling confidential HR data\) 
* an e-sign system controlled by our partner law firm, Cooley

HR-related agreements should not be executed using the company-controlled DocuSign account given HR privacy requirements
