# Mattermost U.S. Consulting Agreements

This agreement is typically used for vendors who do not require Mattermost to sign a [custom agreement](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#procuring-a-vendor). Before you kick off the process, please confirm your vendor satisfies the criteria below. If you're not sure, please reach out to [Procurement Team](Procurement@mattermost.com).

## **Criteria:**

* A firm or an individual with an LLC 
* Provide ad-hoc services to Mattermost, examples include:  
  * Project-Based: for a defined period with pre-set project milestones
  * Ad-hoc services: work that is \(i\) not continuous \(e.g. hours vary month to month\) and \(ii\) typically assigned on an as-needed basis

## **Process**

1. Confirm you have [budget approval](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#step-1-send-for-budget-approval) to engage with a vendor.
2. Create a draft of the [Mattermost U.S. Consulting Agreement Template](https://app.hellosign.com/s/GnvOJVYW). Reference the [field description guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKef8xf9N_NTEc0owbAGH4mb0UzU8CJQ5qckGvIl1UM/edit) for help. 
3. [Submit a purchase order on Accrualify](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/purchasing/how-to-use-accrualify/how-to-submit-a-po) and attach the draft to the purchase order request.
