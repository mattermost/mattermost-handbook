# Mattermost U.S. Consulting Agreements

This agreement is typically used for vendors who do not require Mattermost to sign a [custom agreement](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#procuring-a-vendor). Before you kick off the process, please confirm your vendor satisfies the criteria below. If you're not sure, please reach out to [Procurement Team](Procurement@mattermost.com).

## Criteria

* A firm or an individual with an LLC.
* Provide ad-hoc services to Mattermost, examples include:
  * Project-based: For a defined period with pre-set project milestones.
  * Ad-hoc services: Work that's \(i\) not continuous \(e.g. hours vary month to month\) and \(ii\) typically assigned on an as-needed basis.

## Process
