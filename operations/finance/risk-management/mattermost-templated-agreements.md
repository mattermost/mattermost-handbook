# Mattermost U.S. Consulting Agreements

This agreement is typically used for vendors who do not require Mattermost to sign a [custom agreement](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#procuring-a-vendor). Before you kick off the process, please confirm your vendor satisfies the criteria below. If you are not sure, please reach out to [People Ops](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/ask-people-team).  

#### **Criteria:** 

* A firm or an individual with an LLC 
* Provide ad-hoc services to Mattermost, examples include:  
  * Project-Based: for a defined period with pre-set project milestones
  * Ad-hoc services: work that is \(i\) not continuous \(e.g. hours vary month to month\) and \(ii\) typically assigned on an as-needed basis

#### **Process**

1. Confirm you have [budget approval](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#step-1-send-for-budget-approval) to engage with a vendor
2. The appropriate [CAO](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-agreements#what-are-e-sign-completion-expectations) should complete the [Mattermost U.S. Consulting Agreement Template](https://app.hellosign.com/s/GnvOJVYW). Reference the [field description guide ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKef8xf9N_NTEc0owbAGH4mb0UzU8CJQ5qckGvIl1UM/edit)for help. 
3. Upon completion, the CAO will receive the document via HelloSign. Forward that email to [HR](mailto:%20hr@mattermost.com) and include your Vendor's signatory contact information \(full name and signature\). 
4. HR will review the document to ensure the criteria is met and will send out the document for [signatures](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-agreements#who-can-sign-on-behalf-of-the-company) and CC the [CAO](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-agreements#what-are-e-sign-completion-expectations).  
5. Upon receipt of the fully executed agreement via HelloSign, please follow [Procurement Steps 5 & 6](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#step-6-upload-completed-contract) to ensure your vendor is set-up for payment.
