# Gifting Policy

If you attend a call to share feedback for a tool that Mattermost uses or may use, you may be offered a "gift" in exchange for sharing your feedback. The gift could be merchant credits (e.g. a $50 gift card), or a physical item (e.g. AirPod Pros).

Before accepting this gift, please reach out to Expenses@mattermost.com. The accounting team will help assess whether the gift falls under taxable income. The tax rules for gifts depend on your country/region of residence and the value of the gift offered to you.

If any questions or concerns, please reach out to Expenses@mattermost.com, or the Finance Team channel on Mattermost.
