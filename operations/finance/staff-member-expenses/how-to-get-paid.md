# How to get paid

**Effective date**: February 1, 2023

### Payments made by Mattermost

#### United States

If you're a staff member located in the United States, payroll is made through TriNet via direct deposit bi-monthly on the 15th and on the last business day of each month. Your expense reimbursements will be made through Airbase under the Mattermost, Inc. policy in the form of an ACH or wire payment (for international bank accounts). You'll be required to register your banking information to be able to receive an ACH or wire payment in Airbase. We do not support any other type of expense reimbursement for United States staff members at this time. You'll receive your expense reimbursement no later than 15th and at end of each month.

If you're a vendor, refer to the [Vendor Onboarding](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/onboarding/how-to-on-board-as-a-vendor) section for guidance on registering so you can get paid.

#### Rest of World \(ROW\)

If you're a vendor or a contractor located outside the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Germany, Mattermost requires a primary banking institution as a method of payment. You will get paid via Airbase for invoice processing, expense reimbursement, and payment. The currency in which payment is made is based on the currency stated within the agreement signed with Mattermost. For additional information on expense reimbursement policy, please refer to the [how to submit a reimbursement request](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/purchasing/airbase/how-to-submit-a-reimbursement-request) section of the Handbook.

**Primary banking institution**

The person or legal entity the bank account is registered to must be in the name of the contracting individual/entity.

_Example 1_: A staff member named John Smith is located in Spain. He signed a consulting agreement with Mattermost, Inc. under his surname. John Smith must have the following banking institution setup:

* The bank account is located in Spain
* The bank account is his name or other known surname

If you provide information for your banking institution, your invoice and/or expense reimbursements will be made through TransferWise.
