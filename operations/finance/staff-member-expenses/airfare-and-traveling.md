# How to book airfare and travel

### Policy

Mattermost is enrolled in The United PassPlus for Business program. This is a prepaid annual program which gives Mattermost discounted and preferential rates. United PassPlus is not a requirement, but it is a preferred and simple solution to booking business travel without using a personal credit card. We recommend using PassPlus to compare rates prior to booking alternative travel, however use your best judgement in optimizing for price and travel mana \(i.e. inefficient routes\) All flights should be booked in economy unless your travels are eligible for [Upgrades](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/airfare-and-traveling#upgrades). 

1. **Booking Platform**: United PassPlus vs other airlines or ticketing websites \(e.g. Expedia, Delta, etc. which is outside of policy\)
2. **Convenience**: direct flights and/ or 1 layover versus 2 or more layovers which is outside of policy
3. **Timing**: is this a last minute business trip or planned event \(last minute is defined as anything 2 weeks or less from the date of the event which is outside of policy\)

For example purposes, we have provided a few cases in which to assess airfare travel ranking:

**Example 1**: John Stacey is joining the rest of the Mattermost Sales Team in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic for an offsite event. The date is set from January 15-19 and communication on the event went out in October, 3 months prior. The only airlines that fly to Punta Cana are United, Delta, and American. The costs for flights are the following:

* United PassPlus \(1 stop\) at $500
* Delta \(Direct\) at $750 
* American \(Direct\) at $450

How should John go about booking his flight?

John would book United PassPlus or American for the following reasons:

* They are both at or below the the median of the 3 costs
* It’s considered convenient as it’s less than 2 stops
* The event details were provided with greater than 2 week notification to make appropriate travel accommodations

**Example 2**: John Stacey is joining the rest of the Mattermost Sales Team in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic for an offsite event. The date is set from January 15-19 and communication on the event went out in October, 3 months prior. The only airlines that fly to Punta Cana are United, Delta, and American. The costs for flights are the following:

* United PassPlus \(**2 stops**\) at $500
* Delta \(Direct\) at $750
* American \(Direct\) at $450

How should John go about booking his flight?

John would book American for the following reasons:

* American is the cheapest option
* It is more convenient than United as it’s a non-stop flight
* The event details were provided with greater than 2 week notification to make appropriate travel accommodations

**Example 3**: John Stacey is joining the rest of the Mattermost Sales Team in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic for an offsite event. The date is set from January 15-19 and communication on the event went out in October, 3 months prior. **John’s start date is January 10th and is expected to be at the team event on January 15th.** The only airlines that fly to Punta Cana are United, Delta, and American. The costs for flights are the following:

* United PassPlus \(**2 stops**\) at $500
* Delta \(Direct\) at $750 
* ~~American \(Direct\) at $450~~ **\[SOLD OUT\]**

How should John go about booking his flight?

John would book Delta for the following reasons:

* Delta is the most expensive option but convenience and timing are impacting flight schedules.
* It’s outside our policy to fly having 2 or more stops.
* The event is less than a 2 week notification to make appropriate travel accommodations.
