If you're a full time staff member and need to submit an invoice, please follow these instructions so that you'll be paid on time. If you're not sure, please check your contract which will denote how you'll be paid. You can also reference the [How to get paid](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-get-paid) section of the Mattermost handbook for further details.

## Full time staff member (Rest of World - Deel)

If you're a full time staff member who gets paid via Deel, please reach out to the [People Team](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/ask-people-team) for any questions related to the Deel platform. 

## Payment and Expense Reimbursements

For staff members on Deel, you will receive payment from two sources, Deel for payroll and Accrualify for expense reimbursements (expense reimbursements should be submitted on [Expensify](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-use-expensify)). The currency in which you are paid is dependent upon the currency that is agreed upon between you and Mattermost in your employment contract. The Finance team will reach out to you for payment information for your expense reimbursements.
