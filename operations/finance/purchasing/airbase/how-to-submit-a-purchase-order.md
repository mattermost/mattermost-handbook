Enter **Vendor** and **Amount** values. If you can’t find your vendor, you can choose the option **Add New Vendor** from the drop-down menu. Please make sure you enter the amount in the correct currency. We prefer our vendor contracts to be denominated in USD. 
Once you’ve completed the Vendor and Amount fields, select **Next** to continue.

1. Service start date
2. Service end date

4. Secondary Spend Category
5. Description: provide all the critical information that the Finance team may need to review the purchase order. **Incomplete information will cause delays in the process.**
6. Confirm whether there is a legal document that needs to be reviewed. Please attach all appropriate documents to this request. If there are online terms to be reviewed, please provide a URL in the **URL** field located further down the screen.

7. If there is a DPA that needs to be reviewed, attach a copy of the DPA as well.
8. Please indicate whether the request is for a consultant or contractor.
9. If the request is for a consultant or contractor AND they need an Mattermost email, please indicate here. This is a very important step as we will need to include IT and PeopleOps to ensure the consultant or contract is onboarded properly in our systems.

Scroll down the page and complete all remaining fields within the **04. Accounting Details** section. Instructions for fields in this section are included below:

1. Subsidiary: Do not change the subsidiary. All vendor contracts will roll under the Mattermost, Inc. entity.
2. Categories: From the drop-down menu, please select the appropriate **Category**. See Category definitions for details.
3. Add tags: From the drop-down menu, select the appropriate tags for **Class**, **Department**, and **Location**. See class definitions for details.

You can ignore **Transaction Tags**.

In section **.05** of the form, you can choose to generate a purchase order document. This is an option for your vendor; it’s not a requirement for the Mattermost Finance team.

Once you’ve completed the purchase order form, select **Submit**. This will kick off your purchase order request, and the appropriate authorized approvers will be notified. 

For additional information on spend approvals and spend thresholds, please refer to the [Authorization Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDIMiO0uydB_1zCUxZ4sGfSnBJ0P_49zbeQGgTqbYPI/edit#gid=1632055194).

**Important**: The authorized approvers for vendor contracts are the CFO (<$100K) and the CEO (=>$100K). If individuals other than our authorized signers sign a vendor contract, the contract is null and void.**
