When giving or receiving a gift, ask yourself:

1. Is this gift nominal in value?
2. How will others and the public perceive this gift?
3. Could this gift be seen in any way as a bribe?
4. Will this gift influence the decisions made by the recipient?
5. Am I truly building up goodwill and trust, as well as strengthening working relationships with this gift?
6. Am I breaking or violating the local laws by accepting or giving this gift?
7. Does this gift go beyond the common courtesies consistent with ethical and accepted business practices?
8. Was this raffle or giveaway done randomly and in a public forum? Is the prize excessive?
9. If the appropriateness of the gift is in question, has a manager been consulted?
10. Do I understand the intention of giving or receiving the gift?
11. Have I alerted my manager of the gift?

When giving or receiving a gift, the gift must be of nominal value and there is no risk of creating a perception that the gift, in any way, shape or form, influenced the recipient of their decision making. Gifts of nominal value can be company swag, like mugs, t-shirts, stickers, or other promotional items. In some cases, a gift can be a gift card or certificate for participating in a survey or testing a new product and providing feedback. This is an acceptable form of gift, so long as the amount is no more than $50 USD. Entertainment can be a meal, refreshment, such as an alcoholic beverage or soft drink, or a ticket to a cultural or sporting event. For example, inviting a customer to MatterCon.

As a reminder, staff members are required to follow the local laws for the country that may apply and when in doubt, please consult their manager prior to giving or receiving the potential gift.

### Unacceptable gifts

It is never acceptable to give or receive gifts or entertainment that are in exchange for personal gain, unfair business advantage or influence decision making. It is also never acceptable to give or receive gifts or entertainment that is illegal, per local country laws, or that would violate Mattermost’s mission or values. 

An unacceptable gift can be:

1. Excessive cash amounts
2. Gift items of excessive value
3. Stocks
4. Bonds
5. Stock Options
6. Loans

In the event that a staff member receives a gift or entertainment that is deemed unacceptable, inappropriate or illegal, the staff member should report it to their manager and politely return the gift and explain that Mattermost policy does not permit them to accept the gift. In the event that a gift cannot be returned, the staff member should reach out to the Compliance team for assistance.

_Government and Political Activities_

Under no circumstances should gifts or entertainment be given to or received from government officials, employees or contractors as this may appear to be a means of influence or bribe. Failure to avoid these activities may lead to violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. For additional information on the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, please refer to this [page](https://www.trade.gov/us-foreign-corrupt-practices-act#:~:text=Under%20the%20Foreign%20Corrupt%20Practices,of%20obtaining%20or%20retaining%20business).

Staff members have the right to support the political process as it applies to their home country. Support for these political affiliations should be conducted during their personal time and should not be conducted on company time or involve the use of company resources. Staff members are not permitted to make any political contributions on behalf of Mattermost.

_Charitable Contributions_

As with political activities, staff members may not use company resources to personally support a charitable organization or other not for profit organizations. Staff members are not permitted to make any charitable contributions on behalf of Mattermost.
