# Renewals

If your purchase request is a renewal of a service and the renewal meets the criteria below, please refer to this guidance to successfully submit your request to the Finance Team.

Please submit a PO in Accrualify if your renewal meets **all** the following criteria:

1. The services being renewed are the same as last year. This means that the renewal does not include additional services or expanding services.
2. The amount for the renewal is the same as last year.
3. The renewal falls under a master services agreement \(MSA\) that is still active \(not expired or terminated\) or the terms and conditions \(T&Câ€™s\) are the same as last year.

Please see the decisioning tree ![here](../../.gitbook/assets/Purchase-Decisioning-Tree.png).

If all of these criteria are not met, please refer to the Purchase Decisioning Tree to determine next steps \(submit a budget, submit a PO, legal review etc.\).
