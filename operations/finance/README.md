## Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on January 31.

Prior to February 1, 2019, our fiscal year ended on September 30. Following years start February 1, end January 31 and have 12 months. To illustrate:

| Fiscal Year | Start Date | End Date | Months |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2020 | Feb 1, 2019 | Jan 31, 2020 | 12 |
| 2021 | Feb 1, 2020 | Jan 31, 2021 | 12 |
| 2022 | Feb 1, 2021  | Jan 31, 2022 | 12 |

We originally had a fiscal year end of September 30 when we were a video game company so we could do our taxes in the fall, when tax accounting firms had more capacity versus in the spring.
