# Lead Management

## What is a lead?

Leads are defined within our CRM across a variety of types. Sales will engage primarily with Marketing Qualified Leads \(MQLs\) which are broadly defined by leads which characterize a potential intent to purchase the product. See here for a [list of MQL definitions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1LYvBcLyQHqwNoj4skOTqq_-Rp_UyEOXBrinc4oh9c/edit?usp=sharing).

Sales will either engage with MQLs in an automated or manual fashion as defined in the [sales engagement document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VlabDMukHNC-FSip9tKftTmXfYnOLqkg19WiGZqNmjA/edit).
