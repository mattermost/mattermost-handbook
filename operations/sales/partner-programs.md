## Mattermost Partner Program FAQ

Frequently asked questions from Mattermost partners.

### Can a partner sell Mattermost products without revealing the name of an end customer?

No, Mattermost, Inc. must be informed of all end customers with whom it conducts business. This ensures that Mattermost can provide ongoing service and renewals if the reseller relationship ends. Additionally, Mattermost cannot engage in business with customers in countries under U.S. embargo, which must be verified for any commercial transaction.
