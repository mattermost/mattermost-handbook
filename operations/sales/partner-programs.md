To get started, please email the following to partner-directory@mattermost.com:

### Listing location of key office

In the partner listing, city locations follow a "concise clarity" principle:

* Cities that are not well-known, or which have very similiarly-named cities in the same country, are displayed as CITY, STATE/PROVINCE, COUNTRY.
* Well-known and uniquely-named cities, display as CITY, COUNTRY.

For example: A well-known city with a unique name like Johannesburg would be displayed as "Johannesburg, South Africa" and not "Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa", which is unnecessarily long. Similiarly a less well-known city, like "Arvada" is referenced as "Arvada, Colorado, USA".

## Mattermost Partner Program FAQ

Frequently asked questions from Mattermost partners.

### Can a partner sell Mattermost products without revealing the name of an end customer?

No. Mattermost, Inc. must know all end customers with whom it does business. This is important for Mattermost to be able to service and renew the end customer if the reseller relationship is discontinued. Moreover, Mattermost cannot do business with customers in countries embargoed by the United States, and this must be confirmed in any commercial transaction.
