## Writing for Mattermost

The purpose of the [Mattermost blog](https://mattermost.com/blog/) is to help developers learn how they can be more productive and to share how the Mattermost team is solving interesting technology challenges. Our intent is for every piece of content to educate and inspire readers to improve their own productivity, whether they’re troubleshooting individual processes or optimizing workflows for their whole team.

The mission of helping developers be more productive doesn’t mean focus only on productivity tools and tips -- sharing how we solved broader technical problems, interesting tech that we’re excited about, and industry trends and issues are all relevant to the larger goal of helping developers unblock their workflows.

### Great blog submissions

* Are focused on a single, clear topic 
* Cover a new topic or angle that isn’t already part of our content catalog
* Are written concisely and clearly, and formatted for easy skimming
* Include images or other visuals that enrich the reading experience \(videos, gifs, infographics, charts, etc.\)

Check out [this post](https://mattermost.com/blog/monitoring-cloud-environments-at-scale-with-prometheus-and-thanos/) and [this post](https://mattermost.com/blog/ci-cd-pipeline-security/) for examples of well-focused content.

### Our content wishlist

While we don't have a specific content wishlist, we welcome a wide variety of content submissions, especially on techinical topics. If you're not sure if a topic would be appropriate for the Mattermost blog, feel free to ask on [~Mattermost: Content](https://community-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/mattermost-blog).

If you’re looking for inspiration, here are a few general types of post that we’re always looking for more of:

* How we solved a technical problem, e.g. [Monitoring Cloud Environments at Scale with Prometheus and Thanos](https://mattermost.com/blog/monitoring-cloud-environments-at-scale-with-prometheus-and-thanos/)
* How we built or designed a feature for our product, e.g. [How Mattermost approaches accessibility for the visually impaired](https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermost-accessibility-for-the-visually-impaired/)
* Best practices \(or at least, our practices\) for a common workflow or process, e.g. [An Introduction to CI/CD pipeline security](https://mattermost.com/blog/ci-cd-pipeline-security/)
* How to use Mattermost in a unique way, e.g. [5 workflow automations for Mattermost that we love at n8n](https://mattermost.com/blog/5-workflow-automations-for-mattermost-that-we-love-at-n8n/)

After you’ve submitted your post to the Content team, we’ll review it and get back to you within 3 business days with any feedback or suggestions. Articles may require up to 2 rounds of revisions.

Here are the types of edits and feedback you can expect to receive:

* **Grammar and spelling errors:** We check the post for grammatical issues, spelling errors, etc. Generally, there is no follow-up required for these edits. 
* **SEO review:** Search engine optimization helps ensure that our content is discoverable in search engines and is more visible online. These edits include changes to the title and headings of the post, rephrasing some sentences to include target keywords, and adding backlinks to other content. Generally, there is no follow-up required for these edits. 
* **Additional recommendations for scope and clarity:** To ensure that every post fulfills our editorial mission statement, we may ask for additional edits with the goal of making your post more accessible and useful to readers. These might include:
  * Reordering sections within the post for flow
  * Splitting a long post into two or more articles
  * Removing sections that don’t support the core topic of the post
  * Adding additional context or detail

You \(and any other required approvers\) will have a chance to review the final version of your post before it goes live. Remember that our goal isn’t to change your voice and tone, just to make you sound like the best version of yourself!

## Publishing

After your post is approved, the Content Team will take care of getting it ready for publication in WordPress and let you know when it is scheduled to be published.

If this is your first time submitting an article to the Mattermost blog, don’t forget to **submit a short bio and a headshot** so we can include it in the post!
