# Content Marketing

The goal of Mattermost’s content marketing strategy is to connect our audience’s priorities to our brand and the future of their industries through story. In H2 2020, we’re focused on building and executing a [strong foundation of content marketing best practices](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/content-marketing/content-development-distribution-processes) and building out a pipeline of content initiatives around the [key topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sVwlZN56dQYy-QVOXtYwlRgAOMaz80Mcl86jzx0KOPE/edit#) for [a few target audiences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GxrnTj6FbFul1MJqCttFe7gt5-gz-OCEg8gzfipLLrI/edit?ts=5f222db3).

## What are our goals?

For H2 2020, our content marketing goals are as follows:

* [Publishing six customer stories](https://app.asana.com/0/1181403834255289/1194040652702369/f) \(case studies, logos, blog interview, webinars\) by end of H2 2020.
* Individual content initiatives are 60% increasing our audience, 20% advancing prospects through pipeline, and 20% enabling sales and champions, and every content initiative has a clearly documented and executed distribution plan.
* Our [Editorial calendar](https://app.asana.com/0/1190898966199137/list) is set at least two weeks out on a rolling basis.
* Every member of the company understands [how they can get involved](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/content-marketing/contributing-content) in developing and promoting Mattermost content.

## Audiences

Understanding who our audience is and what they care about provides the foundation upon which we’ll create all collateral, campaigns, and content initiatives. We kicked things off by building out a framework of [audience definitions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GxrnTj6FbFul1MJqCttFe7gt5-gz-OCEg8gzfipLLrI/edit?ts=5f222db3).

In H2, we’re focused on DevOps practitioners, Incident Response Managers, and Admins. We know that these technical stakeholders are often the entry point into new organizations, and play a significant role in evaluating and adopting new tools. Focusing on these audience segments will allow us to help develop a healthy demand gen pipeline.

## Content themes

There are many, many topics we can create content for, but we are a small team with limited resources. As such, the majority of our content initiatives will focus on developing content around three categories as they relate to our audiences. [See extended positioning statements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sVwlZN56dQYy-QVOXtYwlRgAOMaz80Mcl86jzx0KOPE/edit#).

**Open Source** \(Admins, Buyers, DevOps Practitioners\)

Position: Leveraging open source provides a competitive advantage for enterprises.

**DevOps** \(DevOps Practitioners, Incident Response Managers, Admins in enterprise\)

Position: Teams need collaboration infrastructure that connects the people and the tools they need to effectively practice DevOps.

**Future of Remote Work** \(DevOps Practitioners, Non-technical users, Incident Response Managers, Admins, Buyers\)

Position: As more teams go remote, they need software solutions that enable secure, private collaboration experiences.

These topics/themes will manifest differently at different stages in the buyer journey.
