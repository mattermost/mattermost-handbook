# How to make shared-ready screenshots

### Intention

* **Share-ready** - Provide "share-ready" screenshots showing Mattermost product in format easy to share in documentation, social media and marketing content 
* **Archive-ready** - Make screenshots and visual assets easy to archive and re-use 

### Taking a screenshot

* **Right-size the product** - Size your Mattermost Desktop App or browser to capture a screenshot approximately 900px by 640px excluding browser navigation 
* **Right-size the asset** - capture within the 900x by 640px frame

#### Example of share-ready screenshot

![DO: Size Mattermost to capture approximately a 900px by 640px area](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

#### Example of non-share-ready screenshot

![DO NOT: Screenshot Mattermost at high resolution where text is hard to read when image is reduced for sharing on social media and possibly in slide ](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

### Sharing a screenshot

1. **Share the original** - Always share the original in .JPG or .PNG format, or pasted in a slide 
   1. If you share screenshots in a slide with a drop shadow or other formatting, make sure the original is provided as a backup in case the user needs a different manipulation 
2. **Share the manipulation \(optional\)** - If you're modifying screenshots using a format that can include layer or the original manipulation \(e.g. Photoshop\), offer the file containing modifications if you can in .PSD or .TIF format.
