# How to write Mattermost Case Studies

## Case studies

This document outlines some of the procedures and materials in developing an effective case study for Mattermost software. This template can be used both to describe deployments of the open source Mattermost Team Edition or commercial deployments with Mattermost Enterprise Edition. We’re delighted to hear everyone’s story and to share it with the community.

### What to know about technical case sStudies

Case studies are valuable for any audience, but for technical audiences they provide a great opportunity to show off the potential value of your product to an audience that often bristles at conventional marketing. With that in mind, here are a few things to focus on when creating case studies for developers, security architects, quality engineers, and other technical buyers:

* **Context matters.** Capturing the broader landscape of our customers’ workflow and tooling, and how Mattermost fits into that landscape is essential.

  Don’t forget time to value. Technical folks know that a new tool isn’t often something that will be ready to use “out of the box,” so case studies can be a good place to show that set up and maintenance won’t be a major issue.

* **Get the right people in the room.** The value that a CTO gets from a product and the value that a developer gets can be very different conversations. If you’re not speaking with the right person, you might get a lot of vague answers to key questions.

Taken from Ashley’s guide to [Writing Case Studies for a Technical Audience](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18UL7LNOIcYkZ4NEF-aeDfhXDq7pyoSvwvEq9hmLrKks/edit#) for Heavybit.

### Case study requirements

Our goal with case studies is to highlight our most successful customers and share how they're benefiting from using Mattermost. Our general requirements:

* Customer has completed a deployment of Mattermost.
* Customer’s use case aligns with a use case we want to emulate.
* Customer has been actively using Mattermost for at least three months.
* Customer has general approval to participate in case studies and other promotion materials, i.e., there are no bans on participation.

### Case study process

Mattermost, Inc. is excited to highlight interesting use cases from across our customer base to bring attention to your company and how it’s benefiting from using Mattermost.

The process is approximately as follows:

1. Customer meets the above Case Study Requirements outlined above.
2. Customer case study contact is introduced to a Mattermost case study coordinator over email and completes a questionnaire \(below\).
3. Mattermost case study coordinator arranges a 30-minute phone or video call with the customer for a discussion around the questionnaire and deployment.
4. One to two weeks later a draft case study is sent to the customer for review and approval \(in a shared Google document\). Customer is asked to complete reviews within 3-5 business days and is given a target publication date.
5. Mattermost case study coordinator and case study owner take turns to politely follow up with the customer either the day before the customer has stated that the review will be ready, in order to confirm that the review is coming, or approximately every 2 business days after the initial 3-5 day window if an estimate of the draft case study review time is not known.
   * In follow-up emails, it is important to take into consideration what can be done for the customer, rather than what the customer can do for us, e.g. “Circling back to see if there is anything I can do to help the case study review proceed more smoothly? Happy to help, just let me know.”
6. When the customer has completed a review of the draft case study and approved it, the customer feedback is incorporated into the draft blog post in Google Docs.
7. Mattermost case study coordinator prepares for publication:
   * Commissions a banner to be featured in the case study blog post. Please see “Marketing: Graphics” channel for examples on how to commission banners.
   * Creates a draft blog post  to promote the case study in WordPress. The draft is then reviewed for formatting, grammar, and other [style guidelines](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines).
   * Drafts social media posts to promote the case study.
8. The blog post is then published and may be used in other marketing materials to share the benefits of a Mattermost solution with other potential customers.
   * The case study coordinator follows up with the customer to share a link to the final case study, thank them for participating, and encourage them to share on their company's social channels.
9. Case study owner writes a description of the case study with key details, to be shared with Sales, Customer Success, and other teams.
   * Ex. “We’re excited to introduce our latest case study with Worldline. Worldline first started using Mattermost because they needed a more secure alternative to Slack. Mattermost gives Worldline a central collaboration space that its distributed team uses to find information, organize projects, and speed up development workflows using the Mattermost GitLab plugin.”

### Case study interview process

* The call will take place after the customer case study contact has completed the above questionnaire.
* The case study writer should also be on the call.
* At the beginning of the call, the customer is asked if they’re in agreement that the interview be recorded to ensure accurate note-taking. Once agreed, the interview is then recorded via Zoom and the recording is transcribed after the call.
* A draft of the case study, in appropriate format, is sent to the customer for review 1-2 weeks after the call.

### Writing guidelines

1. Don't use slang or jargon. Write so that people with English as a second language can understand every sentence.
2. Don't criticize the competition or disparage other products. It’s okay to factually address differences on why Mattermost was selected.
3. Don't mention staff size if less than 250 people.
