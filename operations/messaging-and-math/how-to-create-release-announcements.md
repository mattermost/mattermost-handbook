# How to create release announcements

### **Goals**

* Get community excited about our momentum 
* Increase discovery of features and contributions 
* Make people feel AMAZING for contributing 
* Everything should be ready to share
  * Every paragraph feels like it's ready to copy and paste into a tweet. 
  * Every person we thank who is on Twitter, we Tweet to them

### **Process**

* Writer drafts announce with feedback
* Release manager checks for spelling mistakes, features included, screenshot guidelines are met 
  * PMs review for features and content are technically correct
  * Marketing reviews
* Head of PM reviews 
* CEO review
* Blog post published
* Tweets from blog post are queued \(Tuesdays 10am PT, and Thursdays 10am if there's extra\) - Writer 

### **Checklist for review of draft:**

The Release Manager \(Amy Blais\) owns the release announcement, including the following checklist items unless otherwise indicated:

1. **Exciting title**
   1. Do not lead with a competitor parity feature 
2. **Compelling, specific one-liners**
   1. Introduce features with compelling, concise, specific descriptions
   2. If the feature is a filler for a release, be vague and add it at the end of the blog post, e.g. "Performance improvements to mobile" **\(please avoid when possible\)**
3. **Complete**
   1. No spelling errors or broken links
   2. All features PM team wants to highlight are included
      1. **\(PM team owns\)** Check for technical accuracy and statement of benefits 
   3. \(**Author owns\)** All contributors are recognized with a screenshot 
      1. Names should not be red-underlined \(if they are, add them to the dictionary prior to taking a screenshot\)
      2. Screenshot not surrounded by a border
      3. Below the screenshot, include a text version of their names in small font with a link to their GitHub handle
4. **Screenshots**
   1. [Follows screenshot guidelines](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/messaging-and-math/how-to-guides-for-m-and-m/how-to-create-screenshots-and-gifs)
   2. Do not use screenshots rated at high quality
      1. **\(Author owns\)** Rate each image High, Medium, Low quality
         1. **High** - Beautiful, highly compelling, grabs attention in a social stream 
         2. **Medium** - Tells a story clearly, readable text, right size 
         3. **Low** - Bare minimum to call an image 
   3. **\(Author owns\)** Draft Tweet text for all screenshots included
      1. Contains version hashtag, e.g. \#mm518

### **Style Guidelines**

1. Highlight past successes: Cross link to promote traffic 
2. Links tell a story: Links should indicate the content they lead to without clicking, avoid "read this blog post" and instead "learn more about the incident response alpha program"

### One great screenshot a month

1. Each monthly release R&D should aspire to come up with a "Hero" screenshot following guidelines to use as the splash image for the release.
2. Titles:
 - Use ``plugins`` not ``plug-ins``
 - Tone: Communicate the primary benefit
3. If a screenshot isn't available to highlight in the release use a conceptual banner based on [R&D Twitter Banner Template](https://community.mattermost.com/files/6bc4cot5xbyi8cfxesgyx6aqdw/public?h=HKLm3FZvOvpylxVk7mUYmeaBQ_rFV_JCEAZ2w5z9fg4) \(shown below\)
