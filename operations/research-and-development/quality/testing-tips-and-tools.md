## Telemetry Testing

**Review the** [**Mattermost Telemetry Handbook**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CJeMFxnwUq8njKd3S3zxnfqrwUz8zNDsTmUAYqgy_uo/edit?usp=sharing) **for bug fixes relating to server, web-app, mobile, and/or plugin telemetry.**

The handbook contains step-by-step instructions for adding and/or updating telemetry, as well as QA-ing test data. Resources contained in the handbook include: telemetry scoping requirements for PM/Dev/QA, standardized Rudderstack development implementation processes, and dashboards to monitor test data.

## Test Servers

## Email Aliases

If you need an additional email address for testing purposes, GMail supports email aliases in the format `email+alias@domain.com`, such as `john.smith+testing@mattermost.com`. The characters following the `+` in the email address make that email unique while still ensuring that you receive that email in your inbox.
