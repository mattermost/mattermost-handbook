# Delivery

## Mission
The Delivery team enables Mattermost Engineering to deliver products of **high quality**, **secure**, **scalable**, and **efficient** fashion to Mattermost customers. The team ensures that Mattermost bi-weekly, monthly, security, and patch releases are publicly released in a timely fashion.

The team creates the workflows, frameworks, tools, architecture, and automation for Engineering teams to see their work reach production effectively and efficiently. 

## Actions
- CI/CD blueprints, tooling & infrastructure for dev & testing workflows 
- Automation test framework
- Automate release generation and reduce Release Manager toil work
- Improve security principles in Mattermost software supply chain
- Extend release environments to improve testing for Mattermost releases

## Principles
- Guard and raise end-product quality standards
- Treat our work like a product
- Promote self-serve
- Aim to make our work easy to use
- Influence best practices
