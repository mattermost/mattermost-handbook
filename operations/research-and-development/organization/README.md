# R&D Organization

The source of truth for the R&D org structure and team membership is [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lH8QIjQGEoGospDUdVs_LQ_i2b82I1ce6W7z18vhPTQ/edit#gid=1820415931). For an overview of all teams and areas of responsibility please see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKNUNAhMS1Yf7yfsh-mrvMHV-r1heCNdeMUTmVq4RFY/edit) (*note that some data may be out-of-date between this doc and the handbook, the handbook is considered our official listing).
