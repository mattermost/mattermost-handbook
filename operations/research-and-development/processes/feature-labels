# Feature Labels

Mattermostâ€™s feature labels serve as indicators of the status, maturity, and support level of each feature, helping users and administrators navigate product feature adoption with clarity and confidence. They communicate the stage of development, level of readiness, and potential risks associated with a feature for customers seeking to adopt new value. 

### Experimental
Solution is an early Proof of Concept (POC) with an unstable codebase, minimal QA, and potential UI issues. Security reviews are incomplete, making it unsuitable for production. Distribution of the solution is limited, and our Cloud environments are typically not eligible to use experimental features. Caution is advised as the solution may be discarded if its value is not proven. 

### Beta
Solution is in active development towards General Availability. Not fully complete, but reviewed by our security team, adoption is suitable by a small set of customers behind a feature flag. Identified bugs are fixed on a best effort, but no major breaking changes anticipated. Beta is a transitional stage, meaning the solution is maturing but requires careful consideration in a full production deployment as scale and client availability may vary.

### General Availablity 
Solution has undergone thorough validation and testing. It is feature-complete, meets quality standards, and has successfully passed security reviews. GA features are suitable for widespread production deployment and adoption, as they offer stability and reliability, with no expected changes that could disrupt functionality or scalability.

### Candidate for Deprecation
Solution is being considered for removal from the product due to redundancy, low usage, or compatibility issues. It is still functional but is no longer actively developed or enhanced. Only severe bugs and security issues are addressed. Users are encouraged to transition away from using this feature towards alternative solutions. 

### Deprecated
Solution is officially marked for removal from the product. It is no longer supported or actively maintained by the development team. While the feature may still be available in the current version, it is recommended for users to discontinue its use and migrate to alternative functionalities.

### Community Supported
Solution is maintained by the open source community rather than the official development team. While it may receive updates, enhancements, and bug fixes from community or partner contributors, there is no guarantee of timely or comprehensive support. Users are encouraged to seek assistance and contribute to the ongoing development of the feature through community forums, documentation, and collaboration platforms.
