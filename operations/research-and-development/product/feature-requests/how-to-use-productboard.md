# How to Use ProductBoard

## **1 - Day in the life of a Product Manager**

### **1a- Reviewing new feedback from users and customers**

New feedback from users and customers is sent to the [Insights Board](https://mattermost.productboard.com/insights). Typically these are submitted by fellow product managers, support, customer success managers or sales through integrations with email, Zapier, Zendesk or others.

When in the Insights Board, you can either go to your [Personal Inbox](https://mattermost.productboard.com/insights/my-inbox) or a [Shared Team Inbox](https://mattermost.productboard.com/insights/shared-inbox) to review feedback. When you find something relevant to your initiatives, highlight it in the notes and click the pencil icon to attach it to a feature

You can either link the feedback to an existing feature request, or create a new one.

Finally, you will choose how important this request is for the user or customer. For feedback coming from customers, this is typically shared by the appropriate team member in the customer team who has first-hand knowledge of the criticality of the request.

Linking feedback directly to features lets you easily capture and organize ideas. It also attaches customer information and request details automatically from the call notes to the detailed product feedback \(dependent on available integrations, one for a two-way native Salesforce integration is coming soon\).

### 1b - Prioritizing features in the Features board

Second critical element is prioritizing features in the Features board.

Usually you would start from the [Feature Organization View](https://mattermost.productboard.com/feature-board/1097524-feature-organization) which has all features broken in a [product hierarchy](https://www.productboard.com/blog/product-hierarchy-set-up/) by feature teams, epics and stories. 

* Feature teams is the top-level category and refers to the corresponding R&D team, such as Apps, Platform and Integrations
* Epics are high-level theme such as Compliance or Client-Side Performance
* Stories are individuals features within those themes, such as 508 Compliance or Improving Channel Load Times

In this view, you can filter and sort by various fields, and create custom views that you can refer back to later. Available filters include

* User Impact Score, calculated based on number of requests, weighted by how important it is to them. [Learn more how the score is calculated here](https://help.productboard.com/en/articles/882615-use-the-user-impact-score-to-surface-your-top-requested-feature-ideas).
* Drivers and prioritization scores. _**To add details once weâ€™ve decided on the configuration.**_ [Learn more here](https://help.productboard.com/en/articles/1552014-use-drivers-and-prioritization-scores).
* Segments, in our case whether it is a feature for Core \(TE\), Professional \(E10\), or Enterprise \(E20\)
* Tasks, such as the status of designs or development
* Releases, which identifies an internal target for which release the feature is scheduled for

Two other commonly used views include the [Top Requests View](https://mattermost.productboard.com/feature-board/1097530-top-requests) which automatically filters all feature requests to those with highest user impact scores, and a [Prioritization Matrix](https://mattermost.productboard.com/feature-board/1097533-prioritization-matrix), which provides a 2x2 visualization of the value a set of features gives to an objective against the level of effort.

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2834%29.png)

With these views, including custom ones you can create, you can prioritize features and surface priority requests in the Features board. Based on the prioritization, you can change the feature status to a Candidate for roadmap, or Planned for roadmap. _**// Do we have an optimal way of doing this?**_

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/productboard-feature-status.png)

Once the feature is in progress or released, you can update its status in ProductBoard accordingly.

Note that each time you update the status of a feature or add a comment, anyone who is a watcher will receive an email notification. In the initial roll-out, watchers are limited to Mattermost team members only.

_**// If a feature is marked as Planned, do we want to automatically create a space in Confluence and an epic in Jira as proposed in previous PM standup?**_
