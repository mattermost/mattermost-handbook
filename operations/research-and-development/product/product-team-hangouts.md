# Product Team Hangouts

To promote social connections and build stronger team cohesion within the product org, we are launching Product Hangouts - a weekly, audio-only session via Zoom that brings the entire product team together \(20 team members across PM, UX, analytics, community, tech writing\).

These sessions are optional and will take place after the weekly R&D meeting on Thursdays, at 10am PT. No preparation necessary - join to hang out with your fellow Product team members!

The first of these sessions will be on June 10, 2021. Hope to see you there!
