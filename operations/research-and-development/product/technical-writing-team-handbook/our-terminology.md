# Terminology

The language we use at Mattermost is extremely important. When we use consistent terminology it means we're all speaking the same language, and our customers know what to expect whether they're on the website or in the product documentation.

Terminology standardization started in 2022. The project has a large scope and includes:

- Standardizing headings to make them sentence case.
- Standardizing all text in the System Console to make them sentence case.
- Standardizing how we refer to our products and plans, as well as the mechanisms available to use them.
- Changing the casing of words to lowercase where appropriate.
- Making our Edition and License page consistent and clear.
- Creating a UI text library of terms and strings for the UX team to use when creating mocks.

The [outline of the project is documented here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImzS3UhCkFzMF2-6FNByw9W2r8Gvx1sudBA0FjazVH0/edit#heading=h.crjl4fz9pz1n).

## Sentence case headings

We decided to change our headings to sentence case to:

* Decrease friction for contributors so they wouldn't have to "take a stab" at getting heading capitalization right.
* Bring our documentation format in line with current industry standards around readability.
* Make our documentation easier to read.

This is a work in progress with the documentation having been completed in Q1 of 2022. The scope of the project extends to the Mattermost website, developer documentation, Handbook, and integrations content. There is no date set for completion.

## Product and plan terminology

"Mattermost sells subscription plans for both cloud and self-hosted deployment. Self-hosted deployments will need to upload a license file to activate the subscription."

All of our products are subscription plans. However, our self-hosted deployments also require a license file which is downloaded during the purchase process.
