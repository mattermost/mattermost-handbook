The majority of Mattermost technical documentation is written in `.rst` format. However, there are some instances where Markdown is used, for example the Mattermost Handbook. You can read more about using Markdown in the [Formatting Text](https://docs.mattermost.com/messaging/formatting-text.html) section of the Mattermost product documentation.
