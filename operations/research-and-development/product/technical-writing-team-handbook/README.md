### Contributing to documentation

The basic outline for getting started with contributions is provided in the [README](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/blob/master/README.md) of the docs repo. If you have write access to the repo, you can create a branch off master and work on that.

Once complete, submit your Pull Request \(PR\). Ensure that you assign appropriate approvers and labels - if you've forked the repo or don't have the correct repo permissions you may not be able to do this, so you can skip this step. Read more about the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review) - it applies to various types of contributions including documentation.

### Submitting feature documentation

Feature documentation is a joint effort between Product Managers and Technical Writers. In the same way that we want to empower everyone to contribute to our documentation, Product Managers are encouraged to write MVP documentation for their product/feature.

**Note:** Due to the cadence of the release cycle, feature documentation needs to be complete and submitted as [per the release process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/feature-release#e-t-minus-15-working-days-judgment-day) to allow sufficient time for review and to ensure it's included in the release documentation update.

The supplied content can be provided informally, in bullet points, or rough notes in a Google Doc/Jira issue/on the PR itself. Refinements are made collaboratively.

**Feature documentation MVP \(PMs\)**

This is a guideline of what MVP feature documentation can include. Requirements vary based on the scope of the change, so not everything will always be needed:

* A link to the feature/product's tech spec.
* Links to any relevant Jira/GitHub issues.
* A description of the product/feature/update which forms the basis of the documentation.
* Steps for any processes or procedures \(configuration of a feature, troubleshooting, etc\).
* Any FAQs or troubleshooting questions if relevant.
* Configuration settings and examples for the `config.json` file if relevant.
* \(If possible\) Suggestions of where in the docs the content should go.

When the content has been refined and approved in draft format:

* The Product Manager/Technical Writer creates a branch off the relevant documentation release branch.
* The documentation is updated with the approved content in that branch.
  * If there are multiple pages to update for a specific feature/change please keep them all in the same branch for ease of management.
* The PR is submitted and relevant reviewers added, including an editor \(not the Technical Writer who wrote the docs\), for final review.
  * Include the link to the server/webapp repo issue in your PR for reference purposes.
* Once all reviews are complete, the PR is marked as **Reviews Complete** and merged into the documentation release branch by @amyblais.

You can read more about the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review).

### Submitting documentation with your PR

We want to empower everyone to contribute to our documentation, and be comfortable submitting documentation for contributions. As such, we don't expect every contribution to adhere to our style guide when first submitted.

During the review process the editorial team also provides feedback on style elements to bring the submission in line with the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/core.html#documentation-style-guide).

Here are some guidelines:

* When submitting a PR, please include updated documentation if applicable.
* The documentation update can be in the form of a bullet list or an outline.
* Label the PR as **Docs Needed**/**Editor Review** and tag @justinegeffen or @carriewarnermm.
* The documentation you've submitted will be reviewed.
* At times, the editors may make and commit stylistic changes \(such as punctuation\) but any content changes will be added as a suggestion for the submitter's consideration.
* Once the PR is approved, it will be merged, and the documentation will be updated.

You can read more about the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review).

**Note:** This process does not apply to the [API Documentation requirements](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-api-reference) as it is updated automatically and isn't part of the documentation process.

### Adding reviewers to PRs

The full list of R&D teams is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lH8QIjQGEoGospDUdVs_LQ_i2b82I1ce6W7z18vhPTQ/edit#gid=0).

### Requesting Documentation via Doc Up

Requests for documentation can be made within [community.mattermost.com](https://community.mattermost.com), using the Doc Up plugin embedded in the post menu.

![Access the Doc Up plugin by hovering over a message and clicking the &quot;...&quot; menu.](../../../.gitbook/assets/doc-up-plugin.png)

When you select Doc Up and choose **Admin** as the issue type, an issue is generated in the GitHub docs repo, and added to the issues list. An update is listed in the Documentation channel, with the issue link.

You can also select **Developer** or **Company Handbook** to direct the Doc Up request to the appropriate repo.

As the issues are open to the community, the more information provided in the issue the better.

Review the issue in the [docs repo](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), [developer documentation repo](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-developer-documentation/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), or [handbook repo](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and add any links to appropriate documentation and/or Jira tickets. This ensures that the assignee is able to take on and complete the work within the turnaround times.

**Turnaround time**

When the issue has been created, please follow these guidelines to assign [labels](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/labels). This ensures that the issues are prioritized appropriately.

There are a number of variables at play, such as review process, current workload, and type of work required which makes it difficult to provide a hard and fast time-frame for completion. Large projects might be moved to Jira if required.

**Assignees**

Documentation does not have to be written by the Technical Writer/s. You can raise an issue, complete the requirement, and submit a Pull Request.

**Community involvement**

We really want the community to own the docs as much as possible. In light of this, please mark your issue as **Help Wanted** so that community members are able to identify work that they‚Äôre able to assist with. If your documentation request/issue applies to a repository other than _mattermost/docs_, you can use the **Docs Needed** and **Editor Review** labels and/or ping @justinegeffen or @cwarnermm.

### i18n contributions

**Note: This process is a 1% draft.\***

Our User's Guide and Administrator's Guide are available for translation contributions. Join the [i18n channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization) on our Community server and connect with our translation community members. The documentation translation process is still being defined.

Currently, submitting a translation PR follows the same writing and editing process as other PRs. However, there are additional considerations to bear in mind when submitting your PR as these assist with the approval and merge process:

1. Do you have an active test instance running with the integrations guide translated so we can validate the rendering and formatting?
2. If the content you're translating includes screenshots should we keep the original English versions of the screenshots, or consider translated versions of them too?
3. If the intention is to translate the screenshots, is there a proposed process for keeping them up to date?
4. Have at least one member of UX team and one member of Apps PM team review the user experience in choosing different languages.
5. To maintain high standards for translated documentation, set up a process to notify translators when something is changed in the English-version of the docs, and expectation on correcting translations for new releases.
6. Decide if we want to indicate translations level - e.g. ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù or ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù for translations that are in progress.
7. Test you can successfully rate a translated docs page by selecting a rating emoji. Ping @justine.geffen for validation of this.

## General contribution workflow

### Jira Tickets

The [Technical Writing Jira board](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=80) is a snapshot of the current Technical Writing workload.

If you have a feature, UI copy, or general documentation requirement, please create a ticket and include the following fields:

* Label: Documentation
* Team: Tech Writing
* Assign the ticket to the relevant writer.
* Select a sprint.
* Add the "docs/needed" label so the issue shows up on our board.

For best results, please include as much content, context, and detail as possible.

If the Jira ticket is for documentation related to a release, the documentation needs to be complete at least 10 days prior to release. Please ensure you allow sufficient time for your request to be completed or it will be moved to the next available slot.

### Editing requests

When submitting a PR for documentation, whether it's a minor update, a new piece of content, or a content proposal, please add the **Editor Review** label \(if possible\). Once the Technical Writer/Editor has reviewed the PR they'll remove the label. When all the requested reviews are complete, the **Reviews Complete** label is applied and the changes are merged.

### Providing editorial feedback

If you're asked to provide editorial feedback on a PR, and it's your first editorial feedback request, first read up on the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review) to get an idea of what's expected in terms of turnaround time, type of feedback, and so on.

Editorial feedback is based on the guidelines laid out in the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/core.html#documentation-style-guide) as well as the [Voice, Tone, and Writing Style Guide](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines).

### Formatting and Style Guide

The [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/core.html#documentation-style-guide) and [UI text guidelines](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/documentation-UItext-guidelines.html).

## Community documentation involvement

Every month the Mattermost community plans, builds, tests, documents, releases, and supports new product improvements for Team Edition to benefit the user community. The Mattermost Enterprise Team does the same for Enterprise Edition to benefit the subscriber community.

A critical part of this development is documentation which ranges from feature documentation to FAQs, guides, and tutorials.

### Feature documentation

Feature documentation is a collaborative effort between the Product Manager and Technical Writer within a specific timeframe aligned with releases. Community members are welcome to assist, if the time expectations are manageable.

Feature request documentation is usually located in the [mattermost-server](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ADocs%2FNeeded) repo and the [mattermost-webapp](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3ADocs%2FNeeded) repo and are labelled as `Docs/Needed`. As these are tied to a release \(and a deadline\) it‚Äôs best to only take on the work if you‚Äôre sure you can complete it on time. It‚Äôs understood that community members contribute in their available time, which is why this type of documentation isn‚Äôt usually the best option to take on.

### Help Wanted tickets/doc issues

Help Wanted tickets are generally not linked to a release and are more flexible in terms of timeline and delivery date. You can find the documentation Help Wanted tickets [here](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/labels/Help%20Wanted). To start working on one, assign it to yourself, add a comment indicating you‚Äôll be working on it, find the relevant document in the [source](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/tree/master/source) directory, read through the [README](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/blob/master/README.md) file if you're not familiar with the process, and get started.

If you have any questions, you can post them in the [Documentation](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/documentation) channel and we'll be happy to help.

### Engineering/developer documentation

Most, if not all, contributions to the Mattermost project have a documentation impact. As part of the development and submission process, it‚Äôs recommended that the relevant documentation be updated \(or created\) and included in the PR. This provides consistency and accuracy in communicating the changes/new feature and cuts down on having multiple issues and PRs for related documentation.

Visit the [Contribute to Documentation](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/publishing/publishing-guidelines/voice-tone-and-writing-style-guidelines/submitting-documentation-with-your-pr) page to get started with submitting documentation with your PR. You can read more about the review process [here](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/code-review).

## PR tips and best practices

* Try to submit files in batches rather than single PRs per file. This reduces the PR load and also groups your changes more effectively.
* When there are lots of changes requested, especially on a docs PR where the changes are "safe" (meaning they don't need to be QA tested), you can use the "Add suggestion to batch" feature in GitHub to commit all of the suggestions at once. You have to be in the "Files changed" tab to actually use the feature, though it is also shown in the "Conversation" tab. Then you can use one commit message like "Added batch suggestions from @Carrie Warner". This just makes the commit history of the PR a lot more readable and useful.
* Descriptive PR titles and commit messages go a long way, especially when the PR is referenced in the future. The default PR titles that GitHub gives us like "Updated README.md" are not very helpful because there's no way to know the purpose of the PR by reading the title. For all the reviewer knows, maybe the whole file was translated to Japanese because we realize that's our main audience, but I wouldn't know if that was the case unless it was in the PR title.
