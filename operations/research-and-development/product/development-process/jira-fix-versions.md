# Jira Fix Versions

Developers, Product Managers, Release and Quality Assurance teams use the Fix Version field for the following purposes:

- Developers: 
  - Fix Version field is the one that shows up on individual tickets in the backlog view.
  - For Story tickets, the Fix Version is used for soft guidelines for what is targeted for what release. 
  - For Bug tickets, the Fix Version is used to know which bugs are priority based on where we are in the release cycle.
- Product Managers:
  - To prioritize backlog.
  - To estimate/plan what Story tickets ship in what release.
- Release Manager:
  - Follow status of resolved, open and submitted tickets for current release.
  - Compose various release metrics.
- Quality Assurance:
  - Prioritize testing of tickets and associated PRs for the next release.
  - Assess completeness of a release before cutting final.
  - Track when changes actually went in, to help investigate bugs and expected behavior.
  - Report on issues, changes, and tests by release.
