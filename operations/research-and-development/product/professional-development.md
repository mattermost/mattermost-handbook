# Professional Development Tracks

This page outlines professional development tracks available to all product team members (Product Managers, Product Designers, Technical Writers, and Product Analytics Engineers)

## Objective: 

1. Provide different professional development tracks that employees can use to grow their skills based on areas that are interesting to them in their career journeys. 
2. Within the tracks, be more prescriptive on how to spend the budget, so there are less barriers for employees to use the budget on professional development.
3. Provide a process in which employees can be accountable for their own development and foster an environment of sharing their learnings. 

## Programs: 

Mattermost provides a [Professional Development](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/staff-member-expenses/how-to-spend-company-money#other-expenses) allotment of $500 to all staff. After Org 360 feedback conducted and shared in the 5/19/2021 Customer Obsession meeting, the product org increased professional development budget and professional development track, thereby increasing our investment in career development as employees grow with Mattermost. 

Below are the various track discovered following research and discussions with product stakeholders. If you do not find a track or program of interest to you, please speak to your manager! We aim to be flexible in providing the right professional development that suits your interest and career progression.
