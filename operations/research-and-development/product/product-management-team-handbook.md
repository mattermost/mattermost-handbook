## The Product Manager Role

### Function within the Organization

Product Managers are organized within the R&D area of Mattermost; however, they have interactions with all departments and areas to ensure success of the product.

### Strategic Priorities

Product Managers are responsible for carrying out the strategic priorities of the product. They are tasked with ensuring the product is profitable by meeting customers and users existing and future needs. Understanding that each client and user have their own set of specific requirements, use cases, and preferences; a Product Manager must understand the patterns across a broad range of input and focus on exploiting value in the areas that will provide the greatest return for the largest audience.

Feature and improvement requests from our Enterprise customers are logged by Sales Architects, Customer Success, and Support in a [Customer Request Jira project](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=17&projectKey=CR&view=planning&issueLimit=100).

Please encourage collegues to add tickets when they are discussing requests in Mattermost channels, so that we have single source with all requests. Product Managers are responsible for reviewing Customer Requests regarding features and product improvements. New tickets may already be assigned to a PM based on area of responsibility. Please review tickets often to address newly created tickets and to update any older tickets as new information becomes available. For each ticket or request:

* Work with Customer Success and Sales to clarify use cases, root issues they are trying to solve, and prioritization of request
* Propose alternate solutions when they are available
* Determine if the feature is a feature that we would add to the product
* When an alternate solution is not available and we would add the feature to the product, get a high-level estimate of level of effort to develop a solution from the Engineering team
* Add additional customer use cases to existing tickets. Encourage colleagues to add additional use cases to existing tickets as they gather information from their customer interactions
* Link any implementation or design tickets to the request
* Update the **Fix Version** of the feature to provide an indication of when the reporting request may be addressed. Generally, **Planned: Near Term** means it will be addressed in the next 1-3 releases, **Planned: Ongoing** means it's something that's being actively worked on, but progress may be slow, `Planned: Unscheduled` means we plan on addressing, but it is not currently on the roadmap, **Future Consideration** means we need to collect more details on use cases and demand before scheduling into a future roadmap and **Not Planned** means that we will not be working on addressing the request
* Update the ticket status to **Closed** when a feature is completed

#### Customer Request Rotation

In sync with the Twitter rotation, Product Managers rotate responsibility weekly for monitoring newly-filed [customer requests](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=17&projectKey=CR&view=planning.nodetail&quickFilter=97&issueLimit=100) and ensuring newly filed requests are assigned to the appropriate PM according to areas of ownership. The weekly PM meeting is the time to identify requests where ownership is unlcear or merits discussion. The PM on rotation should also remind fellow PMs in the Product Management channel to review their requests and at a minimum update the Fix Version.

#### Community Success

* Ensure devs are aware and included on community contribution projects.
* Prep Help Wanted tickets with specifications on feature and designs as needed.
* Help teams come up with and prepare community contribution campaigns.
* Answer questions and coordinate resources to community contributors.
* Review community contributed PRs.

#### Mattermost Forum

#### Twitter Rotation

Product Managers rotate responsibility weekly for monitoring and responding to Mattermost mentions on our corporate Twitter account. The PM on rotation can be found in the header of the [Mattermost Twitter channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/twitter). The rotation switches on Monday and is scheduled alphabetically by first name. The PM on rotation will be mentioned on the first day of their rotation. The PM that was previously on rotation should reach out to the new PM on rotation to hand off the duties and to remind on the additional responsibilities of assigning unassigned Customer Requests. Below are the responsibilities of the PM on Twitter rotation:

* Update posts in the Twitter channel with action taken
  * React with `:heart:` if you liked the post
  * React with `:repeat:` if you retweeted the post
  * React with `:no_entry_sign:` if you took no action
* Assign any unassigned Customer Requests. If you're unsure of who to assign, ask during the PM Meeting.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Can we take this feature out of beta?

To officially release a feature, it should meet the following criteria:

1. **Scalable:** Works for 60k concurrent connections, 60M rows in the database, and in High Availability
2. **Cross Platform:** Works on all web view sizes, mobile apps, desktop apps
3. **Measurable:** Telemetry added where appropriate
4. **Documented:** Complete documentation is available
5. **Secure:** Reviewed internally for security, and included in future security reviews
6. **Accessible:**: Accessibility has been added for user interface components
7. **Logged:** Audit log entries have been added to allow system admins to troubleshoot issues
8. **Compliant:**: Anything needed for compliance is tracked in logs

### How do I create redirects for in-product documentation?

Documentation that is linked in-product should always use a redirect from www.mattermost.com instead of the docs.mattermost.com site, to ensure links are not broken in the event that they are moved on the docs site.

To set up a redirect, you must have admin access to www.mattermost.com. Marketing can assist with this access or @jason.blais or @katie.wiersgalla can add a redirect for you.

If you have access, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the administration panel for www.mattermost.com
2. From the left-hand sidebar, go to **SEO \> Redirects**
3. On the top of the screen, ensure you are on the **Redirects - Yoast SEO** page header on the **Redirects** tab
4. Under **Type**, choose `301 Moved Permanently` option (this is the default option)
5. In the **Old url** field, enter in the new direct you want to use in-product in the format of `/pl/default-page-description`. Update the page description with your page information
6. In the **Url** field, enter in the full URL to the page on docs.mattermost.com
7. Click the **Add Redirect** botton and verify your entry is added to the list. You may need to page through to find your entry
8. Test your redirect URL. This will be the URL in the format of `https://www.mattermost.com/pl/default-page-description.html`
