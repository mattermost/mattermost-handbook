## The Product Manager Role

### Function within the Organization

Product Managers are organized within the R&D area of Mattermost; however, they have interactions with all departments and areas to ensure success of the product.

### Strategic Priorities

Product Managers are responsible for carrying out the strategic priorities of the product. They are tasked with ensuring the product is profitable by meeting customers and users existing and future needs.

Feature and improvement requests from our Enterprise customers are logged by Sales Architects, Customer Success and Support in a [Customer Request Jira project](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=17&projectKey=CR&view=planning&issueLimit=100).

Please encourage collegues to add tickets when they are discussing requests in Mattermost channels, so that we have single source with all requests. Product Managers are responsible for reviewing Customer Requests regarding features and product improvements. New tickets may already be assigned to a PM based on area of responsibility. Please review tickets often to address newly created tickets and to update any older tickets as new information becomes available. For each ticket or request:

* Work with Customer Success and Sales to clarify use cases, root issues they are trying to solve, and prioritization of request.
* Propose alternate solutions when they are available.  
* Determine if the feature is a feature that we would add to the product. 
* When an alternate solution is not available and we would add the feature to the product, get a high-level estimate of level of effort to develop a solution from the engineering team. 
* Add additional customer use cases to existing tickets. Encourage colleagues to add additional use cases to existing tickets as they gather information from their customer interactions. 
* Link any implementation or design tickets to the request. 
* Update the Fix Version of the feature to provide an indication of when the reporting request may be addressed. Generally, `Planned: Near Term` means it will be addressed in the next 1-3 releases, `Planned: Ongoing` means that is something that is being actively worked on, but progress may be slow, `Planned: Unscheduled` means we plan on addressing, but it is not currently on the roadmap, `Future Consideration` means we need to collect more details on use cases and demand before scheduling into a future roadmap and`Not Planned` means that we will not be working on addressing the request. 
* Update the ticket status to closed when a feature is completed. 

#### Community Success

* Ensure devs are aware and included on community contribution projects.
* Prep Help Wanted tickets with specifications on feature and designs as needed.
* Help teams come up with and prepare community contribution campaigns.
* Answer questions and coordinate resources to community contributors.
* Review community contributed PRs.

#### Mattermost Forum

#### Twitter Rotation

Product Managers rotate responsibility weekly for monitoring and responding to Mattermost mentions on our corporate Twitter account. The PM on rotation can be found in the header of the [Mattermost Twitter channel](https://community-daily.mattermost.com/core/channels/twitter). The rotation switches on Monday and is scheduled alphabetically by first name. The PM on rotation will be mentioned on the first day of their rotation. The PM that was previously on rotation should reach out to the new PM on rotation to hand off the duties and to remind on the additional responsibilities of assigning unassigned Customer Requests.
