## The Product Manager Role

### Function within the organization

Product Managers are organized within the R&D area of Mattermost; however, they have interactions with all departments and areas to ensure success of the product.

### Strategic priorities

Product Managers are responsible for carrying out the strategic priorities of the product. They are tasked with ensuring the product is profitable by meeting customers and users existing and future needs. Understanding that each client and user have their own set of specific requirements, use cases, and preferences; a Product Manager must understand the patterns across a broad range of input and focus on exploiting value in the areas that will provide the greatest return for the largest audience.

Please encourage colleagues to file feedback in productboard when they are discussing requests in Mattermost channels, so that we have single source with all requests. PMs are responsible for reviewing the productboard feedback, and assigning it to relevant feature ideas. As they are reviewing the requests, PMs may also:

* Work with Customer Success and Sales to clarify use cases, root issues, and pain points as well as the priority of the request to the customer
* Propose alternate solutions and workarounds when they are available
* Provide feedback on whether it's a "Won't Do" feature that we are unlikely to add to the product
* Update the feature idea to link any implementation or design tickets
* Update the **Effort** for the feature with a SWAG from the Engineering team
* Update the feature idea to have a release timeframe (3 months, 6 months, future) or release version if the feature is planned

After adding the feedback to the relevant idea in productboard, the PM comments and mentions the reporter so they are aware the feedback has been processed, and then marks the item as **Processed**.

#### Community Success

* Ensure devs are aware and included on community contribution projects
* Prep Help Wanted tickets with specifications on feature and designs as needed
* Help teams come up with and prepare community contribution campaigns
* Answer questions and coordinate resources to community contributors
* Review community contributed PRs

#### Mattermost Forum

#### Twitter rotation

Product Managers rotate responsibility weekly for answering product question escalations on Twitter. Twitter is monitored by the marketing team, and they will @mention the PM on rotation in the Twitter channel when they need to escalate a question.

The PM on rotation can be found in the header of the [Mattermost Twitter channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/twitter). The rotation switches on Monday and is scheduled alphabetically by first name. The PM on rotation will be mentioned on the first day of their rotation.

### How do I create redirects for in-product documentation?

Documentation that is linked in-product should always use a redirect from www.mattermost.com instead of the docs.mattermost.com site, to ensure links are not broken in the event that they are moved on the docs site.

To set up a redirect, you must have admin access to www.mattermost.com. Marketing can assist with this access or @jason.blais or @katie.wiersgalla can add a redirect for you.

If you have access, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the administration panel for www.mattermost.com
2. From the left-hand sidebar, go to **SEO > Redirects**
3. On the top of the screen, ensure you are on the **Redirects - Yoast SEO** page header on the **Redirects** tab
4. Under **Type**, choose `301 Moved Permanently` option (this is the default option)
5. In the **Old url** field, enter in the new direct you want to use in-product in the format of `/pl/default-page-description`. Update the page description with your page information
6. In the **Url** field, enter in the full URL to the page on docs.mattermost.com
7. Click the **Add Redirect** botton and verify your entry is added to the list. You may need to page through to find your entry
8. Test your redirect URL. This will be the URL in the format of `https://www.mattermost.com/pl/default-page-description`
