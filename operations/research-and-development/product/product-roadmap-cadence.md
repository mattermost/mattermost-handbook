# Product Roadmap Cadence

## **Overview**

This page provides an overview of product roadmap cadence and timeline, and how it is aligned with [MLT cadence](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/mlt-cadence).

## **Roadmap Planning Cadence**

At Mattermost, our planning cadence consists of: 

1. **Yearly** - Company fiscal year and long term product strategy planning
2. **Quarterly** - Roadmap and Quarterly OKR planning 
3. **Monthly** - Check in on OKR status 

Since we follow an agile development style, our roadmap is an [agile roadmap](https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-roadmap/how-do-product-managers-build-an-agile-roadmap). We plan a roadmap quarterly, following the process outlined below.

Before each quarter begins, we lock on plans for: 

* **What’s Launching** - Key initiatives we plan to work with Marketing on launching this quarter 
* **What’s In Progress** - Key initiatives we will start working on this quarter, but may not ship until a future quarter

We also update the backlog to show which items we are considering for 6 to 12 months out, but this list is flexible and gets updated each quarter based on any changes to company strategy, product goals, community needs, and market conditions. 

### Yearly Planning

See [company handbook](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/mlt-cadence#fiscal-year-planning) for information on how we do company planning for the fiscal year. We typically use [VPMOMs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-vpmom) as a structure for our yearly plans. 

### Quarterly Planning

1. Research:
   1. **Business goals** - Understand how the product \(Core, Teams, Enterprise\) can impact the Company VPMOM. Review company metrics. Identify areas we are doing well and areas we need to improve. 
   2. **Product telemetry** - Review product KPI dashboards. Identify areas we are doing well and areas we need to improve. 
   3. **Community feedback** - Overview of feedback captured in Uservoice, Jira, customer call notes, NPS surveys, app store reviews, forums etc.
   4. **Customer requests** - CS and Sales each submit a prioritized list of asks for next quarter. A call is held so PMs can understand the requests and prioritization rationale. 
   5. **Competitive positioning** - SWOT analysis for Mattermost compared to competitors. Overview of competitor roadmaps, recent releases, and trends in the market. Recap of any news on players entering or leaving the market. Review with marketing, sales, and CS. 
   6. **Dev-driven initiatives** - Identify key upcoming dev-driven initiatives, and understand the goals behind them.
2. Prioritization:
   1. **Discuss product goals** - Reviewing the research, product working groups \(Core, Teams, Enterprise\) meet and propose any changes to key product goals to focus on. 
   2. **Backlog overview & SWAGs** - Based on research, PMs update list of items being considered for the roadmap \(make sure to include dev-driven initiatives\). PMs work with teams to SWAG items. 
   3. **Propose key themes** - Based on research, identify key themes that will have the highest impact on our goals.
   4. **Map out strategic value** - Map out where themes or backlog items fit in a matrix 
      1. Value vs Cost \(Effort/Risk/Complexity\)
      2. Urgency vs Importance
   5. **Prioritized list** - Based on the above, stack rank the initiatives. \(Using a prioritization framework such as RICE may be helpful here - if we switch to a new tool we can work on a custom framework\). 
   6. **Determine mana budget** - Determine how many resources are available this quarter. If needed, map out which people will be needed for which projects. 
3. Roadmap: 
   1. **Goals** - Summarize goals
   2. **Big rocks / Themes** - Highlight the key initiatives impacting those goals. Please include: 
      1. An overview of top initiatives that will be worked on
      2. An overview of what is planned to ship in the quarter \(identify which are “must haves” and which have flexibility\)
   3. **Launches** - Identify at least one key marketing launch for the quarter. 
   4. **Reference** - 
      1. **Backlog Review** 
         1. **Request Review** - For the submitted list of asks from CSMs, SAs, and Support, highlight which were accepted, which were not, and why
         2. **Prioritized List** - Share prioritized list, so people can see the backlog of items considered and discuss why the selected ones were prioritized over others
      2. External Commitments - Track any concrete or estimated timelines we have shared externally
4. Roadmap Reviews: 
   1. **1% - Align on Goals** 
      1. Working Group 
      2. Product & Engineering Leadership
   2. **50% - Get Buy-in on Prioritization** 
      1. CSM/SA/Support 
      2. \(Future\) Customer Advisory Board 
      3. Product and Engineering Leadership 
   3. **99% - Finalize and publish** 
      1. Exec team - Product Leadership presents to MLT, and any feedback is brought back to the PM team. If needed, one more MLT call may be scheduled to finalize any decisions. 

### Monthly Updates

Each team sets up a monthly meeting with Product and Engineering leadership to share progress on quarterly goals. 

1. First 45 min
   1. Entire team \(Dev, Design, PM, QA\) attends
   2. Review Quarterly OKRs
