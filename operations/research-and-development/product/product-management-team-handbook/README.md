## The Product Manager role

Product Managers are organized within the R&D area of Mattermost; however, they have interactions with all departments and areas to ensure success of the product.

### Strategic priorities

Product Managers are responsible for carrying out the strategic priorities of the product. They are tasked with ensuring the product is profitable by meeting customers and users existing and future needs. Understanding that each client and user have their own set of specific requirements, use cases, and preferences; a Product Manager must understand the patterns across a broad range of input and focus on exploiting value in the areas that will provide the greatest return for the largest audience.

Please encourage colleagues to file feedback in productboard when they are discussing requests in Mattermost channels, so that we have single source with all requests. PMs are responsible for reviewing the productboard feedback, and assigning it to relevant feature ideas. As they are reviewing the requests, PMs may also:

* Work with Customer Success and Sales to clarify use cases, root issues, and pain points as well as the priority of the request to the customer
* Propose alternate solutions and workarounds when they are available
* Provide feedback on whether it's a "Won't Do" feature that we are unlikely to add to the product
* Update the feature idea to link any implementation or design tickets
* Update the **Effort** for the feature with a SWAG from the Engineering team
* Update the feature idea to have a release timeframe \(3 months, 6 months, future\) or release version if the feature is planned

After adding the feedback to the relevant idea in productboard, the PM comments and mentions the reporter so they are aware the feedback has been processed, and then marks the item as **Processed**.

#### Community Success

* Ensure devs are aware and included on community contribution projects
* Prep Help Wanted tickets with specifications on feature and designs as needed
* Help teams come up with and prepare community contribution campaigns
* Answer questions and coordinate resources to community contributors
* Review community contributed PRs

#### Mattermost Forum

#### Twitter rotation

Product Managers are mentioned to assist in answering product question escalations on Twitter. Twitter is monitored by the marketing team, and they will @mention the PM team in the Twitter channel when they need to escalate a question. PMs should respond to questions in their area of ownership.

### Organizational improvements

* Increase productivity of department
  * Make progress on quarterly goals and OKRs for department
* Enable other departments
  * Training
  * Develop features for internal systems
* Increase community awareness
  * Research and propose additional ways to engage with existing community and identify new opportunities for community engagement

## Frequently Asked Questions \(FAQ\)

### How do I create redirects for in-product documentation?

Documentation that is linked in-product should always use a redirect in the form `https://mattermost.com/pl/<default-page-name>/` instead of a hard-coded link to mattermost.com or docs.mattermost.com. This ensures in-product links are not broken in the event that they are moved.

To set up a redirect, follow these steps:

1. Decide the in-product link in the form `https://mattermost.com/pl/<default-page-name>/`, and identify the destination URL.
2. Enter the desired route link and the expected destination URL in the [Product Linkout Redirects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O601H_A0IM8pR3FOfue29_C8flGV7xK3ts-tJUVDHHg/edit#gid=607040777) spreadsheet, on the **Requests** tab.
3. Submit a [Marketing Asana Ticket](https://form.asana.com/?k=AYDfCAlUYXPLy0bAlaFWJg&d=279683980846511) for your link request.

Marketing will notify you when the new link is available, and will add the new link to the **pl** tab of the spreadsheet.

For a Marketing team member who adds the redirect, follow these steps:

If the destination URL has a hash (ex. `https://destination.com/example-slug#anchor`), follow the directions for Yoast, otherwise, use WPEngine.

#### WPEngine
1. Login into the User Portal.
2. Go to the production mattermost.com instance in the dashboard and find the **Redirect rules** link.
3. Click the **New redirect rule** button in the top-right corner of the page.
4. You do not need to enter a name for the redirect.
5. For the **Domain** field, choose `mattermost.com`.
6. For the **Source** field, enter the new direct you want to use in-product in the format of `^/pl/default-page-description/?$`.
7. For the **Destination** field, enter the full destination URL.
8. Open the **Advanced Settings** dropdown and for the **Type**:
  * Choose `301` \(this is the default option\) if the destination is unlikely to change.
  * Choose `302` if the destination could change. Browsers will cache and not pick up the change for a while if you set it to `301`.
9. Click the **Save** button. Your new entry will be located at the bottom of the list.
10. Test your redirect URL. This will be the URL in the format of `https://mattermost.com/pl/default-page-description`.

#### Yoast
1. Log in to the administration panel for https://mattermost.com/.
2. From the left-hand sidebar, go to **SEO > Redirects**.
3. On the top of the screen, ensure you are on the **Redirects - Yoast SEO** page header on the **Regex Redirects** tab.
4. Picking the redirect **Type**
  * Choose `301` \(this is the default option\) if the destination is unlikely to change.
  * Choose `302` if the destination could change. Browsers will cache and not pick up the change for a while if you set it to `301`.
5. In the **Old url** field, enter in the new direct you want to use in-product in the format of `^\/pl/default-page-description\/?(\?.+)?$`. Update the page description with your page information.
6. In the **Url** field, enter in the full URL with a `$1` right before the hash (ex. `https://docs.mattermost.com/example-slug$1#report-a-bug`).
  * This is so any URL params get placed in the right spot so the anchor behavior remains. 
7. Click the **Add Redirect** botton and verify your entry is added to the list. You may need to page through to find your entry.
8. Test your redirect URL. This will be the URL in the format of `https://mattermost.com/pl/default-page-description`.
