# Mobile App Release Process

The Mattermost Mobile Apps team works on a monthly release process, with a new version submitted to the iOS App Store and Google Play Store on the 16th of each month.

Please refer to [the Mobile Release Playbook](https://community.mattermost.com/playbooks/playbooks/yxb6yyckgbrebe8eiuzmb6w8co/outline) for a most up-to-date checklist.

**Note: iOS App Store approval may take a few days after the 16th.**
