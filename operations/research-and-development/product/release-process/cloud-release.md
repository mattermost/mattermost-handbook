# Cloud Release Process

This document outlines the Cloud release process for the Mattermost core team. Our release process draws from many best practice Agile, Scrum, and Software Development Lifecycle methodologies.

## Release Timeline

Notes:

* All cut-off dates are based on 10am in San Francisco [\(Pacific Time](http://everytimezone.com/)\) on the day stated.
* T-minus counts are measured in "working days" \(weekdays other than major holidays concurrent in US and Canada\) prior to release day.

### A. \(T-minus 9 working days\) Merge master to the Cloud branch

1. Release Manager:
   * Ask Cloud SRE team to update the community-release server to the same version as the Mattermost Cloud test installations.
   * Confirm all Jira tickets are resolved for QA testing.
   * Notify QA that the test servers are ready for QA testing. Normally QA testing starts on the next day \(at T-8\).
     * Post a list of new feature flags and major features for QA and PMs, and confirm with PMs that all features are behind a feature flag.
   * Ask Tech Writer to work on docs.
   * Keep track of any regressions on master for fixing.
   * Add Cloud release dates to the Release Google Calendar.
   * Start working on the changelog \(both internal and external\).
   * Check whether any translation PRs, pre-packaged plugins, and `NOTICE.txt` PRs are needed.
2. Dev:
   * Merge latest `master` into the Cloud branch after Server team's review.

### B. \(T-minus 0 working days\) Release day

1. Release Manager:
   * Post in Announcements channel with a link to the changelog.
   * Confirm that the Cloud SRE team updated the community-release server to the new version.
   * Schedule a retrospective.
   * Confirm PMs are aware of upcoming Cloud release dates and feature complete dates.
   * Merge docs and the changelog PR.
   * Close the release in Jira.
