# Focalboard Release Process

This document outlines the Focalboard release process for the Mattermost core team. Our release process draws from many best practice Agile, Scrum, and Software Development Lifecycle methodologies.

## Release Timeline

Schedule for Focalboard releases:
 - (T-3): 
 - (T-0): Release Day

On the first day of each month, the Focalboard team's Product Manager and Dev Lead choose which recent release they will include in the next self-managed release pre-packaged version.
The deadline to get the pre-packaged version to the self-managed release is by self-managed Code Freeze day. The pre-packaged version is tested a few days prior to self-managed Code Freeze day.

## Notes

 - Use Incident Collaboration Playbooks / checklist for releases.
 - Publishing a release: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11uLGhYYNnsulL1oUAlfFyNcT3wgAiDJmCSvnNkuAbpA/edit#heading=h.6kw7puo0cpnm
