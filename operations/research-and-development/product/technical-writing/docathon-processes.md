# Docathon 2021: Getting Started

We're super-excited to work with you! There are a few things you should know before you get started.

## Where to find things

The Docathon covers two areas:

* Product documentation: This lives in the [docs repo](https://github.com/mattermost/docs).
* Developer documentation: This lives in the [developer documentation repo](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-developer-documentation).

## Submissions

You can submit contributions in one or more of the following ways:

1. Open a PR directly from a doc page using the GitHub **Edit** option in the top-right corner of the page.
2. Visit the docs repo, find the page you want to edit, and open a PR that way.
3. Create new content! You may not be able to create a branch for your new content but feel free to create a Google doc and share it with us. We'll work with you on finding the perfect place for it.

## Reviews and editing 

We don't expect perfection so please don't spend a lot of time trying to follow the style guide rigorously. That's our job! Bear in mind that we may edit your PR directly, for stylistic changes. The only reason we do this is because it's quicker - if you have any questions about changes we've made, we'll be more than happy to go through them.
