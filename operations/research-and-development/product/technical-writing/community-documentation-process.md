# Community Documentation

In the past, community-managed documentation lived in the product documentation. In some cases, this created some confusion as although the content was in our product documentation it wasn't written and tested by Mattermost and thus not officially supported.

Additionally, having the content hosted on a static site didn't lend itself to engagement and interaction.

Going forward, our existing community-written documentation will be posted in the dedicated forum category.

## Process for new community-written content

If you've written, or would like to write, new content for Mattermost please add it as a new thread in the [Unofficial Product Documentation](https://forum.mattermost.org/c/docs/37) category.

Once submitted, you'll receive notifications about any activity on your post.

We encourage interaction, especially as well-tested community documentation often ends up being added to our product documentation.
