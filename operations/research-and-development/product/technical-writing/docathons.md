# Documentation Hackathon 2021

The first Mattermost Docathon is being held from July 26th to August 6th 2021.

## What is a Docathon?

Documentation isn't written in a vacuum and it's important to see the customerâ€™s documentation journey through the eyes of our Mattermost community. The best way to do that is to get our community involved! Documentation is also often a great way to get started on your open source contribution journey as it's usually how you get to know the product.

## Who can participate?

The Docathon is designed to provide opportunities for all contributors to get involved, whether new to open source or seasoned contributors. Help us solve technical tooling challenges. Write mobile steps for Mattermost messaging tasks. Correct inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Add or update screenshots, labeled images, animated GIFs, and videos. How do you want to improve the Mattermost product documentation? 

## Can Mattermost staff help?

Absolutely! Here are some ways you can get involved:

* **Help us merge PR submissions:** This will basically just entail helping us go through the PRs with the Documentation 2021 label, making sure they follow our style guide and fix any grammatical issues. This isn't an extremely rigorous process or anything, we just want to make sure anything merged follows some standardization.
* **Help review any technical content for accuracy:** Be actively monitoring the ~Docathon 2021 channel for any questions, and just basically being engaging to anyone who posts. Also being open for participants to DM you if they have questions they dont want to ask in the public channel. Also help relay any feedback to us
^^  This is where i think the most value is overall, because I want everyone who participates to feel as if their efforts are being seen and that this is a positive, fun event for them
* **Help us endorse and/or write recommendations for people on LinkedIn:** This is especially welcome if you help with point (2) and there is someone you personally feel compelled to network with and help out their professional career.
* **Contribute your own content or ideas for either the docs overall, or the event itself!**
