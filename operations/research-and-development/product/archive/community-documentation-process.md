# Community Documentation

In the past, community-managed documentation lived in the product documentation. This created some confusion because, although the content was in our product documentation, it wasn't written and tested by Mattermost and thus not officially supported.

Additionally, having the content hosted on a static site didn't lend itself to engagement and interaction.

Going forward, our existing community-written documentation will be available on the [Mattermost Forum](https://forum.mattermost.com/) within a dedicated forum category called **Unofficial Product Documentation**.

## Process for new community-written content

If you've written, or want to write, new content for Mattermost, please add it as a new thread in the [Unofficial Product Documentation](https://forum.mattermost.com/c/docs/37) category.

Once submitted, you'll receive notifications about any activity on your post.

We encourage interaction, especially as well-tested community documentation often ends up being added to our product documentation.
