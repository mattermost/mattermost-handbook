# Research & Development

R&D includes engineering, QA, product management, and design \(UX, UI\).

### R&D Key Info


**Product Strategy**

* [Analyst Research](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/analyst-research): Analyst meeting tracker, briefing procedures, research. We are currently Gartner clients.
* [Compete](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/compete): Key articles on competitors. Also see [automated feeds from competitor marketing](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/compete-feeds).

### What tools we use

We use a variety of tools at Mattermost. Not every team uses the same tools, and it can get overwhelming to try remember who uses what and where it is.

You can find the list of tools used across each team on [this Airtable sheet](https://airtable.com/shr54GQg6KqZJ0Hkt/tblI4gu3oPUiZazs8).
