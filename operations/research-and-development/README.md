# Research and Development

R&D includes engineering, QA, product management, documentation, analytics, community, and design \(UX, UI\).

### R&D Key Info

* [Analyst Research](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/analyst-research): Analyst meeting tracker, briefing procedures, research. We are currently Gartner clients.
* [Compete](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/compete): Key articles on competitors. Also see [automated feeds from competitor marketing](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/compete-feeds).

### What tools we use

We use a variety of tools at Mattermost. Not every team uses the same tools, and it can get overwhelming to try remember who uses what and where it is.

During onboarding you'll be provided with a list of tools to set up. You can also visit the [Helpdesk](https://helpdesk.mattermost.com/support/catalog/items) to find the tool and request access.

### Where to find information
