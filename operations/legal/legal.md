### Legal Resources

Here's a list of additional resources related to the legal function:

Operations 
* [Signing Authority](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/company-agreements#who-can-sign-on-behalf-of-the-company) - Lists who at the company is authorized to approve and sign.
* [Approvals Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDIMiO0uydB_1zCUxZ4sGfSnBJ0P_49zbeQGgTqbYPI/edit#gid=1731392656) - Lists company-level approvals.
* [File Naming Conventions](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/naming-files-and-agreements) - How files should be named for archiving.

Marketing 
* [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/publishing/publishing-guidelines/brand-and-visual-design-guidelines) - Guidelines on how our trademark and brand are to be used.

Customer Contracts 
* [Export Compliance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KzrhszTlaibtM4APezTS8CFb1vaHxRsnkV9ZFef-Uc/edit#bookmark=id.1todj7iol2os) - Summary of Export Compliance contacts. Also see [Mattermost's Export Control Compliance Number (ECCN) and Overview](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.mattermost.com/about/certifications-and-compliance.html%23u-s-export-compliance-overview&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1645713344381876&usg=AOvVaw1zHBcjFIQ4jtBtJ9Rmc2IX). 
* [Deal Desk Terms & Approvals](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/sales/deal-desk) - Explains the process of how non-standard customer agreements are reviewed and processed.

Procurement 
* [Vendor Procurement Process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/purchasing/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract) - Explains process for procuring from an external vendor.
* [Contract Signing for Vendor Procurement](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/purchasing/contracts-and-signing) - How signing works at the end of a process for Mattermost staff to procure from an external vendor.
* [Using Standard U.S. Consulting Agreement](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/risk-management/mattermost-templated-agreements) - Process to bring on a vendor for services using a [standardized Mattermost consulting agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1qR5Kn3UcktjDipZ-H3UuWdcrLXoJR5RD/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=107885747391106493596&rtpof=true). Using this agreement template can greatly accelerate the speed at which Mattermost can approve services you supply to Mattermost.

### Answering Questions Once (AQO)

When you ask questions to legal@mattermost.com for areas that aren't covered by [owners named in the AOR list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KzrhszTlaibtM4APezTS8CFb1vaHxRsnkV9ZFef-Uc/edit), nor documented in our handbook, and could be use to others, we use a process of "Document-First Question and Answer" to write the answer first and then responding with a link to the answer.

While this takes slightly longer, it pays-off long term by answering questions once.

Also, if you see parts of our documentation or handbook out-of-date, please also mail legal@mattermost.com to let us know.

### Outside council one-pager

If you're an outside council onboarding to work with Mattermost here's what you need to know:

1. Please CC legal@mattermost.com on all communications with Mattermost staff. This helps keep track of projects and documents, and confirm billings.
2. If you have general questions, please ask your "Mattermost Contact" as [listed on this page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KzrhszTlaibtM4APezTS8CFb1vaHxRsnkV9ZFef-Uc/edit).
3. If you have questions on billing logistics, please mail ap@mattermost.com.
4. We use a Green/Yellow/Red system to discuss legal issues. Depending on your specialty we may design the critiera with your input.
 - "Green" is anything minor. Example: Minor changes to our standard agreements, or conforming agreement from an outside party.
 - "Yellow" is an issue that can be signed off by a department head, but should be surfaced as an exception in either our contracts management software or at the company-level. Example: Change of jurisdiction from Mattermost, Inc. to the jurisdiction of one of our subsidiaries.
 - "Red" is an issue that requires written sign-off from either VP Finance or CEO and escalation to Head of Legal. Example: Change of jurisdiction to a region where we don't reside directly or via a subsidiary (which will most likely be declined).
