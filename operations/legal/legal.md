## Legal

This page summarizes where to find legal resources for Mattermost staff.

For legal resources by "Area of Responsibility" please see [Mattermost Legal AORs (Internal)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KzrhszTlaibtM4APezTS8CFb1vaHxRsnkV9ZFef-Uc/edit). which includes the name and contact information of legal specialists by area.

When you have legal questions that aren't coverd in the AORs, please mail legal@mattermost.com.

### Answering Questions Once (AQO)

When you ask questions to legal@mattermost.com for areas that aren't covered by [owners named in the AOR list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KzrhszTlaibtM4APezTS8CFb1vaHxRsnkV9ZFef-Uc/edit), nor documented in our handbook, and could be use to others, we use a process of "Document-First Question and Answer" to write the answer first and then responding with a link to the answer.

While this takes slightly longer, it pays-off long term by answering questions once.

Also, if you see parts of our documentation or handbook out-of-date, please also mail legal@mattermost.com to let us know.
