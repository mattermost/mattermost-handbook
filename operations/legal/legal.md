### How to engage with Mattermost Legal

| **Subject of engagement** | **Information/process** |
:-------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Sales** | |
| Customer Contracts, Requests from Customers to Modify our Standard Terms or Ordering documents, Customer Questionnaires, Customer Forms, any other Customer related documents, Reseller Agreements, One Time Reseller Agreements, Passthrough Resellers Agreements, Fulfillment Reseller Agreements, or any other documents or questions pertaining to revenue generating issues. | Please create a Case in the applicable Account in Salesforce. Instructions can be found under the “Deal Desk” section of the [Mattermost Operational Sales Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3Yb3h7ZQ6oq0NhxPuUEjS6-u34spvdkg8VtUToxNQg/edit). |
| **Export** | |
| Export Compliance or Visual Compliance screenings in Salesforce. | For questions about export compliance or to have a flagged account in Salesforce reviewed, please engage via the [Export Screening - Visual Compliance](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/export-screening---visual-compliance) in Mattermost. Please follow the instructions in the channel header with regards to the information. | 
| **Procurement** | |
| Vendor Contracts, Vendor Renewals, or matters relating to any purchases being made by Mattermost, whether it is the purchase of software or services. | Please do not send your agreements directly to Legal for review. The [Procurement Process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/purchasing/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract) begins in Finance. Procurement will direct the contract to Legal for review at the appropriate time during the process. |
| Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) | Before Legal reviews your vendor agreement, Procurement will ask  you to answer some screening questions about the software or services being procured. If the vendor will be collecting or accessing personal information (names, addresses, email addresses, IP addresses, etc.), you will then be asked to fill out a [DPIA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUi-tS1xbLZLodLsQeresTbGqAoZvV0X1oSnE9efF6I/edit?usp=sharing) which will then be reviewed by Legal and Security to assess the security and risk of the vendor. If approved, you may proceed with the vendor and the contract will then be reviewed by Legal. |
| **Intellectual property** | |
| Trademarks, Copyrights, and other Intellectual Property Rights questions or concerns. | Mattermost has registered trademark protections in dozens of countries, with many more pending. A full list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TtFH5rYcvAqWhG-quZCVtynQ-WB19cHZsqqGuL5QCb0/edit?usp=sharing). If you have questions about trademark registrations or potential infringements of any of our trademarks, you can reach out to Legal on [Mattermost](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/legal). |
| **General, non-confidential, questions** | For quick questions that are not confidential, are not seeking any deliverables, and do not seek any legal advice, you can send a quick note on [Mattermost](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/legal). Mattermost is viewable by all team members in the company so do not include any information that may be deemed confidential or that may be considered privileged or seeking legal advice because it may not be protected as privileged if shared with the entire company. For any general, non-confidential legal questions or requests that do not fall into any of the above categories, but may require a deliverable, you can email your request directly to the Legal email address.|
| **Confidential and privileged matters** | Please reach out to the Head of Legal directly or schedule a Zoom meeting to discuss any matters that you believe to be confidential in nature, if you are seeking the legal advice of legal counsel, or if you are unsure whether or not the attorney client privilege should apply. |
