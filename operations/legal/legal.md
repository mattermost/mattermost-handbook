### Answering Questions Once (AQO)

When you ask questions to legal@mattermost.com for areas that aren't covered by [owners named in the AOR list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KzrhszTlaibtM4APezTS8CFb1vaHxRsnkV9ZFef-Uc/edit), nor documented in our handbook, and could be use to others, we use a process of "Document-First Question and Answer" to write the answer first and then responding with a link to the answer.

While this takes slightly longer, it pays-off long term by answering questions once.

Also, if you see parts of our documentation or handbook out-of-date, please also mail legal@mattermost.com to let us know.

### Outside council one-pager

If you're an outside council onboarding to work with Mattermost here's what you need to know:

1. Please CC legal@mattermost.com on all communications with Mattermost staff. This helps keep track of projects and documents, and confirm billings.
2. If you have general questions, please ask your "Mattermost Contact" as [listed on this page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ILLErliJoTxYRnh04yfCGlsQ15rhkYEki3KIJO-gdE/edit).
3. If you have questions on billing logistics, please mail ap@mattermost.com.
4. We use a Green/Yellow/Red system to discuss legal issues. Depending on your specialty we may design the critiera with your input.
 - "Green" is anything minor. Example: Minor changes to our standard agreements, or conforming agreement from an outside party.
 - "Yellow" is an issue that can be signed off by a department head, but should be surfaced as an exception in either our contracts management software or at the company-level. Example: Change of jurisdiction from Mattermost, Inc. to the jurisdiction of one of our subsidiaries.
 - "Red" is an issue that requires written sign-off from either VP Finance or CEO and escalation to Head of Legal. Example: Change of jurisdiction to a region where we don't reside directly or via a subsidiary (which will most likely be declined).
