# Requesting Sales-related Contracts From Legal

## Sales-related contracts

- All customer and revenue related contracts should be initiated in [Salesforce](https://mattermost.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home).
- For **Software License Agreements** (either Self-Managed or Cloud), the following **minimum** thresholds must be met before Mattermost Legal will deviate from its standard licensing terms (Mattermost [Self-Managed](https://mattermost.com/enterprise-edition-terms/) or Mattermost [Cloud](https://mattermost.com/cloud-subscription-terms/)):
  - Modifications to the standard terms will only be considered if the software order **exceeds $25,000**, and
  - Mattermost will only consider reviewing the customer’s standard agreement if the software order **exceeds $100,000**.

## Requesting a new template

1. Enter into the **"Opportunity"** for which you are looking to have a contract created.
2. Select **"Send Contract"** in the top right corner of the Opportunity.
3. From the drop-down list, select the contract template you would like to create, select **“Confirm”**.

**Note: You will not see the templates for the Software License Agreements if your Opportunity does not meet the minimum threshold for modifying the terms as required above.**

Once you have chosen your template you will be directed to the [SpotDraft](https://app.spotdraft.com/) contract management system. If you do not have access to SpotDraft, you can contact [IT](https://helpdesk.mattermost.com/support/home) and request access.
