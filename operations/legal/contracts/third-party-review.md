**Note: Legal will not review any Sales-related contracts that do not meet the [required minimum thresholds](mattermost-handbook/operations/legal/contracts/sales-related/contracts). Legal will also not review any Procurement related contracts until they have first been submitted through the Procurement process and approved by Finance and and Security.**
