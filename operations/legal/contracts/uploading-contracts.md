# Uploading an Executed Agreement

[SpotDraft](https://app.spotdraft.com/) contract management system is the central repository for all Mattermost contracts, with the exception of PeopleOps contracts. If you have received an original, fully-executed contract, please make sure to promptly upload the contract to SpotDraft. If you do not have access to SpotDraft, you can contact [IT](https://helpdesk.mattermost.com/support/home) and request access.

**NOTE: Please make sure to follow the proper naming convention for [Naming Agreements](mattermost-handbook/operations/finance/naming-files-and-agreements#naming-agreements) which is detailed in the Handbook.**

To upload a contract to SpotDraft, please follow the steps below:

- Click the **“New Workflow”** button in the top right corner of the SpotDraft homepage.
- Choose **“Executed Contract”**.
- Click **“Upload”** in the bottom right hand corner.

[You can skip filling out the Key Pointers in the Excel spreadsheet and fill them out directly in the contract record after the contract is uploaded]

- Press **“Okay”**.

Once the contract has been uploaded, open the contract record and fill in the **"Key Pointers"** fields on the right margin, with the applicable information from the Contract.
