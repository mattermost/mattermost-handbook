# Company Wide Workflows

Here are the workflows that are not specific to the Sales team and a brief description of each.

## Customer Forms & Security Questionnaires

* Use the **Customer Forms & Security Questionnaires** workflow if you need to get a form or questionnaire from your customer completed and approved.
* You can find more information about the Customer Forms & Security Questionnaires workflow, including a video [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FzoFn9QbSajJhkTotbwKAXpkuA14zKtp?usp=sharing).

## Legal Ticket

* You can use the **Legal Ticket** to submit a question you have to Legal. **This is not for submitting a contract for review.**
* Legal will reach out to you with any questions about your ticket and then will provide the resolution via Ironclad, which will email you a copy for your records.
* You can find more information about the Legal Ticket workflow, including a video [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p3DbamDNhl6iNhZ7qM56PQSeZNXkPFgj?usp=sharing).

## Mattermost Templates for Services and Consultants

* Whenever you need to bring on a vendor or consultant, please use the Mattermost template. All the applicable versions are included in 1 easy to launch workflow.
* If you’re not sure which version to submit, complete the form as it makes sense to you and Legal will review the agreement and make any tweaks as needed.
* You can find more information about the Services and Consultants workflow, including information about how to submit for spending approval and a video [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wVMrrqW-OoLDJmhMvoO793fXEKl_Xqkl?usp=drive_link).

## Non-Disclosure Agreements

* Whenever possible you should always be using the Mattermost template. A Counterparty may send you their NDA automatically but as the Workflow Owner, you should push back, at least once but preferably twice, to use Mattermost’s template.  If you must use the Counterparty’s paper, please see the section Requesting Review of a Third-Party Contract.
* You can find the more information about the NDA workflow, including a video [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mFc7heoplPEGQ9CwMhoieT701xX0QCCP?usp=sharing).

## Requesting review of a Third-party contract

* Whenever possible you should always be using the applicable Mattermost template. A Counterparty may send you their template but as the Workflow Owner, you should push back, at least once but preferably twice, to use Mattermost’s template.
* For any **Procurement related contracts**, please submit via **Airbase** which now includes Legal’s review automatically within Ironclad. For more information please see [How to submit a purchase request](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/airbase/how-to-submit-a-purchase-request).
* You can find more information about the 3rd Party Paper workflow, including a video [here](url).

## Software/Tool Approval

* If you are looking to bring on a new software tool that you are not sure will pass Security/Legal/IT approval (think AI tools), you can use the Software/Tool Approval before going through the steps of spend approval in Airbase.
* You can find more information about the Software/Tool workflow [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1su4jHp3K8nhP7KUBpMRFR8ENHn12siV-?usp=sharing).
