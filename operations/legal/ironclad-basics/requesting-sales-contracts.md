# Sales Contracts and Workflows

## Options for Starting a Workflow

* All agreements, including Sales templates, are available via [Ironclad](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/legal/ironclad-basics).
* They are [also available](https://drive.google.com/file/d/109PlgmPV6T5RvbGQjmMhZQ6Tqq7g6NGF/view?usp=sharing) via Salesforce. From the **Account** page, look for the **Get Started** blue button in the Ironclad section. Select the template you would like to start from the drop-down list that will appear in a new window and select **Launch Workflow**.

**Note**: If you do not have access to Ironclad, you can contact [IT](https://helpdesk.mattermost.com/support/home) to request access or ask your manager to submit on your behalf.

Once you have chosen your template, a new tab will open within Salesforce asking you to provide the information required to launch the contract. 

Within Salesforce please follow the steps outlined below for each workflow to submit your contract.
