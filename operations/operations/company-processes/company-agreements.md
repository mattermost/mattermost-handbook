Company agreements should only be signed by CEO, Ian Tien, or CFO, Kendra Niedziejko, with the following exceptions:

* The following agreements may also be signed by the VP Legal, Nirosha Ruwan:
  * Non-Disclosure Agreements.
  * Data Privacy Agreements
* The following agreements may also be signed by the CFO, Kendra Niedziejko.
  * Unmodified Order Forms where the Customer is requesting a Mattermost signature.

## Who can send contracts for signature?

The following staff are approved to send contracts to be e-signed:

## Approved Mattermost staff

* Lynn Conway - Primary for staff agreements
* Amy Nicol - Primary for vendor contracts, consulting agreements, and corporate agreements
* Nikki Johnson - Primary for sales agreements and customer supplier forms
* Jeff Dynda - Approved vendor contracts from legal and customer supplier forms
* Natalie Jew

## What are e-sign completion expectations?

* E-sign request sent on weekdays before 4pm Palo Alto time should be signed by 9pm Palo Alto on the same day and if sent on a weekend signed by 9pm Palo Alto time on the following Monday provided one of the following is true:
  * **For e-sign from Mattermost staff member:** The e-sign is sent by a Mattermost staff member and must have Legal approval. E-signs sent from approved Mattermost staff are preferred since they are archived automatically in our e-sign system.
  * **For e-sign from outside the company:** The e-sign is prepared by a non-Mattermost staff member \(potentially a vendor, partner or customer\) and Legal approval is provided via email to Ian Tien and Amy Nicol ideally ahead of receiving the e-sign request.
    * Within 5 business days of the e-sign completion the contract owner or Mattermost staff submitting for signature should send Amy Nicol a link to the Box.com URL containing the fully executed signature to confirm the archiving of the contract is complete, since archiving is not automatic.
      * **Note:** E-sign requests from non-Mattermost staff are automatically filtered to a spam folder and the spam filter needs to be searched to find the request.
* If the timeline is urgent, or if the e-sign isn't completed by the expected timeline please send Ian Tien and Amy Nicol a Group Direct Message on the Mattermost server to expedite.

### How to wet sign an agreement

* A "wet sign" agreement requires printing and physically signing paperwork with a pen, which is required by some regulatory bodies.
  * Culturally, it is important we have a smooth, clear process that makes physically signing paperwork in a remote company almost as easy and error free as signing in a physical office.
* **Wet sign process**
  * The wet sign process should follow the same workflow process as an e-sign process in terms of oversight and approvals, but instead of running the final e-sign a physical signing packet should be created with:
    * Two copies of printed paperwork to be signed.
      * Each should have sticker labels indicating what is needed to sign, so nothing is missed.
    * A pen.
    * Appropriate envelopes and/or UPS mailing labels to send the signed package on after it is received.
