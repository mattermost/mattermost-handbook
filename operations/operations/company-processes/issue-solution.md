# Issue/Solution Process

Issue/Solution Proposal is a tool for increasing clarity, speed, and output in teams.

We're now on version three of our process. The documentation, video training, and ISP template are hosted internally [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17oHNwYMg_iil3HpGgg1QBIqCX4Q9KoYAyqMvjfwTiGE/edit).

Over time, this page will be replaced with a [Focalboard](https://focalboard.com) page where a summary of our process and template will be hosted.

Note: Special thanks to [Matt Mochary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-mochary-34bb4/) for the framework on which this system is based.
