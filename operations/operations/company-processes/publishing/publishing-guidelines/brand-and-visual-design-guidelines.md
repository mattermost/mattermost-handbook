# Brand and Visual Design Guidelines

## The Mattermost logo

The logos below are available for use in your integrations and applications that connect to Mattermost. Use of the logo is permitted as long as it’s used in a non-commercial way and does not imply endorsement by Mattermost, Inc.

The Mattermost logomark is called **"the instrument"**. It represents four tools that organizations need to achieve their highest priorities:

* A compass for direction
* A clock to set pace
* A meter to measure output
* A dial representing inputs — the contribution of everyone on the team

### Logo variations

The Mattermost logo is available in vertical, horizontal, and logomark-only versions. The logo can be represented in black or white as displayed below.

**Horizontal Logo:** Min size 100x16px

### Usage guidelines

#### Clear space

To ensure an uncluttered presentation, always maintain a full "X" space around the logo. The "X" height is always the height of the lowercase letter "m" in "Mattermost". Use the safety area as an invisible border.

## Name usage guidelines

Using the Mattermost name is generally permitted as long as it’s used in a non-commercial way and does not imply endorsement by Mattermost, Inc.

* Please do not name your integrations or apps starting with, or only using, the name "Mattermost", as this may confuse end-users as to where to find support.

Community projects might be named using "for Mattermost", examples:

* [GitLab Integration Service for Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-integration-gitlab)
* [Giphy Integration Service for Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-integration-giphy)

Alternatively, community projects may concatenate names containing Mattermost, for example:

* [Matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge) – is a Mattermost bridge connecting with IRC
* [Mattersend](https://github.com/mtorromeo/mattersend) – is a Mattermost integration for sending webhook events

**Exception:** Please don’t use the name “matterbot”, as that is an internal service under development.
