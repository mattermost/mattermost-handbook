# What is a Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)?
[According to our list of terms](../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#dri), a Directly Responsible Individual means a human individual who is accountable for a given [Area Of Responsibility \(or "AORs"\)](operations/areas-of-responsibility.md). 

# What do they own? 
DRIs may have different types of AORs depending on their role and function. Ideally, we have a DRI for all metrics, goals, projects, meetings, and decisions. “If something needs to get done, someone needs to do it.” Please see this document for more context on why we need DRIs. 

At the highest level, we think about DRIs in these two contexts: 

## Functional or Product DRI
This AOR is based on an individual’s role in their department. It includes what they are responsible for as part of their core job duties. Some ways we track this are [Mattermost AORs v5](https://community.mattermost.com/boards/team/qghzt68dq7bopgqamcnziq69ao/25b8db83-635b-4469-8c66-37774edbd0c5/b7d3d81e-2c25-4a6c-8937-409d538654cd), and in the handbook, like in [this example](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/organization#product).

Functional or Product DRIs typically have **decision ownership** because: 
- No one external has approval or decision authority on their AOR, only means to provide input. 
- They have an escalation path within their functional leadership to support decision-making.
- AORs are delegated from their functional management chain, and there's a clear Exec sponsor.  

## Outcome DRI
This AOR is based on an individual’s ability to drive outcomes cross-functionally across the organization. This may include strategic initiatives or solving organizational issues. Examples include Cloud DRI, SOC2 DRI, MS Teams DRI, and Growth DRI. 

Outcome DRIs typically have **decision influence** because: 
- They influence the priorities of organizations outside of their direct control, which may or may not be aligned with the skillsets or priorities required to reach an outcome.  
- They need to negotiate and escalate issues across departments to achieve agreement and commitment, with the need to escalate to an apex manager (which in some cases may be CEO). 
- They hold leaders, executives, and ICs accountable for agreements and commitments to contribute work that produces an outcome.

Outcome DRIs are expected to: 
- Work cross-functionally in a manner that improves collaboration through clarity of direction, decisions, and priorities. 
- Be accountable for outcomes where control of resources is not available. Hold leaders, executives, and ICs accountable for agreements and commitments.
- Communicate clearly and cross-organizationally to keep the company aligned on intent, progress, bottlenecks, and next actions ("GNN") 

There may be opportunities to develop your career by being assigned the DRI of a specific organizational outcome. To be considered a candidate for a DRI of an organizational outcome, you have the following skills: 

- High-impact collaborator: Align people from different backgrounds and perspectives on outcomes and shared objectives.
- Influential communicator: Effectively providing context so people can understand the issues and are compelled to contribute to the solution. 
- Stakeholder facilitation: Curate constructive idea sharing, manage an influx of information, and get stakeholders to agree on the most important actions.
- Project management: Able to organize action steps and hold people accountable for completing tasks to progress initiatives to the outcome.
- Empowers ownership: brings people in to be part of the solution based on what value they can bring and can increase ownership across a working group.
