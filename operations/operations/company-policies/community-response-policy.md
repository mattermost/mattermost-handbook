# Community Response Policy

Sensitive topics listed below are escalated to a [Community Escalations channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/community-escalations) in the Private Staff team, which includes all members of the Mattermost Leadership Team (MLT) plus any approved responders. This channel is public, so anyone in the company can escalate an issue. 

When an issue relating to a sensitive topic is raised (for example, on GitHub issues, Twitter, or elsewhere), it should be posted in the Community Escalations channel with an @-mention to the list of approved responders related to that particular issue.

## Escalation Process

Raising an issue is the responsibility of whoever is managing community responses in a given forum. However, it is also open for anyone at the company to escalate an issue that they see.

It is then the responsibility of the approved responders to review the issue and choose an owner for responding (if a response is appropriate). By default, ownership is delegated to the first person on the list of approved responders. 

## Sensitive Topics

Below are topics that only approved responders can engage. If you’d like to be an approved responder for one or more of the topics, we welcome the help! [Sign up here](// XX Need a link), and you will be added to the next training session.

### Non-sensitive topics

Non-sensitive topics include feature requests, troubleshooting questions, bug reports, and other user feedback. 

Anyone in the company is welcome and encouraged to respond, regardless of the medium. If it is your first time responding to the community, please read [principles, tips and sample responses](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/community-guidelines.html#mattermost-community-forums) for help on various inquiries.

### Non-compliance policy

In cases where a staff member who is not on the approved responder list engages with a sensitive topic, one of the approved responders will contact the member in Mattermost to remind them of the community response policy, and ask if they would be interested in becoming an approved responder for one or more of the topics.

Please note that we do not want to discourage you from engaging with the community! If you ever have questions about whether a topic is considered sensitive, ask in the “Community Escalations” channel or ask 1-1 from the Head of Community.
