# Issue/Solution Process

Issue/Solution Proposal is a tool for increasing clarity, speed and output in teams. 

We are now on Version 3 of our process and the documentation, video training and ISP template are hosted internally here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17oHNwYMg_iil3HpGgg1QBIqCX4Q9KoYAyqMvjfwTiGE/edit

Over time, this page in the handbook will be replaced with a [Focalboard](https://focalboard.com) page where a summary of our process and template will be hosted. 

Note: Special thanks to [Matt Mochary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-mochary-34bb4/) for the framework on which this system is based.
