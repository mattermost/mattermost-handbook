## Who are Contract Accountability Owners \(CAOs\)?

A Contact Accountability Owner, or "CAO", is a Mattermost staff member approved to review and initial contracts of specific types ahead of electronic or physical signature on behalf of the company by the CEO.

* Natalie Jew \(HR\) - Employment contracts, benefit contracts, vendor contracts (HR)
* Aneal Vallurupalli \(Finance\) - Sales contracts, corporate contracts, vendor contracts

* Kaelyn Wright - Primary for sales agreements and customer supplier forms
* Natalie Jew
* Aneal Vallurupalli

## What are e-sign completion expectations?

* E-sign request sent on weekdays before 4pm Palo Alto time should be signed by 9pm Palo Alto on the same day and if sent on a weekend signed by 9pm Palo Alto time on the following Monday provided one of the following is true:
  * **For e-sign from Mattermost staff member:** The e-sign is sent by a Mattermost staff member and either prepared by or initialed by an approved [Contract Accountability Owner, or CAO](company-agreements.md#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos). E-signs sent from approved Mattermost staff are preferred since they are archived automatically in our e-sign system.
  * **For e-sign from outside the company:** The e-sign is prepared by a non-Mattermost staff member \(potentially a vendor, partner or customer\) and approved by a [CAO](company-agreements.md#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos) via email to Ian Tien and Amy Nicol ideally ahead of receiving the e-sign request.
    * Within 5 business days of the e-sign completion the [CAO](company-agreements.md#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos) or designee should send Amy Nicol a link to the Box.com URL containing the fully executed signature to confirm the archiving of the contract is complete, since archiving is not automatic.
      * **Note:** E-sign requests from non-Mattermost staff are automatically filtered to a spam folder and the spam filter needs to be searched to find the request.
* If the timeline is urgent, or if the e-sign isn't completed by the expected timeline please send Ian Tien and Amy Nicol a Group Direct Message on the Mattermost server to expedite.

### How to wet sign an agreement

* A "wet sign" agreement requires printing and physically signing paperwork with a pen, which is required by some regulatory bodies.
  * Culturally, it is important we have a smooth, clear process that makes physically signing paperwork in a remote company almost as easy and error free as signing in a physical office.
* **Wet sign process**
  * The wet sign process should follow the same workflow process as an e-sign process in terms of oversight and approvals, but instead of running the final e-sign a physical signing packet should be created with:
    * Two copies of printed paperwork to be signed, including \(if applicable\) e-signed initials from [CAO](../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#cao).
      * Each should have sticker labels indicating what is needed to sign, so nothing is missed.
    * A pen.
    * Appropriate envelopes and/or UPS mailing labels to send the signed package on after it is received.
