# Company Communications

We have a number of different ways we communicate. Use the right side bar to jump to a specific area:

* Customer Obsession Meetings \(COM\)
* Surveys
* CEO Listening Tours

## Customer Obsession Meeting \(aka "COM"\)

This is a weekly all-staff meeting focused on increasing alignment and awareness of how the company, departments, teams and individuals serve our customers.

[Customer Obsession](../../company/about-mattermost/#leadership-principles) is a key leadership principle and we emphasize its priority when we bring the company together. Colleagues who come from companies that aren't obsessed with customers have suggested we refer to this meeting as "All Hands" and not expect everything we announce--from [spending company money](../../company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/) to [recruiting new talent](../../contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting.md)--to be framed in the context of serving customers. Such expectations are typical and common, and therefore we don't have "All Hands" meetings and instead have "Customer Obsession Meetings" to continually remind us that our focus on customers is atypical and uncommon.

## Staff Enablement Survey

Every 6 months we'll be asking staff to spend around 3 minutes completing a staff enablement survey of 12 engagement questions, plus identifying their organizational leader. ‌

* Enablement Survey will be announced in COM meeting 1-week before the survey goes live
* Survey link will be shared at the beginning of COM 
* Link is posted in COM channel with "Thumbs Up" emoji reaction
* All staff are asked to complete the survey and signal completion by clicking on Thumbs Up
* Ideally, the meeting will conclude after Thumbs Up count reaches attendee count but this is not a requirement. 
* An analysis of the results should be prepared and presented in the next 2-4 weeks in COM

## CEO Listening Tours

CEO will be on a series of “listening tours” over Zoom to spend 25-50 minutes with different groups of 5-8 staff within a department to hear likes and wishes about the company. Managers of the team members in the group are typically not in the listening tour group.

The priority of the meeting is listening. During these sessions CEO takes copious notes and refrains from any commentary, though may ask follow-up questions.

At the end of the session CEO reads back what they heard. The notes are shared with the management chain between CEO and the group to share feedback.

It is the decision of managers on how to address the feedback at the team level and CEO will be able to incorporate the information at the company level.

In the past, participants and managers of listening tours have found the meetings productive for uncovering blindspots at the company and within departments.
