# Company Cadence

This section outlines cadence for company-wide operations.

## Customer Obsession Meeting \(aka "COM"\) 

This is a weekly all-staff meeting focused on increasing alignment and awareness of how the company, departments, teams and individuals to serve our customers. 

[Customer Obsession](../../company/about-mattermost/#leadership-principles) is a key leadership principle and we emphasize its priority when we bring the company together. Colleagues who come from companies that aren't obsessed with customers have suggested we refer to this meeting as "All Hands" and not expect everything we announce--from [spending company money](../../company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/) to [recruiting new talent](../../contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting.md)--to be framed in the context of serving customers. Such expectations are typical and common, and therefore we don't have "All Hands" meetings and instead of "Customer Obsession Meetings" to continually remind us that our focus on customers is atypical and uncommon.

## Staff Enablement Survey

Every 6 months we'll be asking staff to spend around 3 minutes completing a staff enablement survey of 12 engagement questions, plus identifying their organizational leader. ‌

* Survey is announced in COM meeting
* Link is posted in COM channel with "Thumbs Up" emoji reaction
* All staff are asked to complete the survey and signal completion by clicking on Thumbs Up
* Meeting is concluded after Thumbs Up count reaches attendee count
* An analysis of the results should be prepared and presented in the next 2-4 weeks in COM
