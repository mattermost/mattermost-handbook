  You can't impact what you don't measure. So at Mattermost we have defined key
  company measures/metrics/KPIs that we monitor to run our business. This
  section is dedicated to this effort.

# Company Measures

* Currently we have 2 main categories of measures:

  * V2MOM: Those measures that support the current fiscal year V2MOM
  * MLT metrics: Existing and legacy metrics that are not part of the V2MOM and still important to running the business.

* Metrics LifeCycle
  * Choose them
  * Define them
  * Document them
  * Automate where possible
    * Central location
    * Reports and Dashboards
