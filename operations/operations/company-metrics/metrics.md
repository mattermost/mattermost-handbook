# Self-Serve Analytics Metric Definitions
The document linked below has been created in hopes of creating a *more* self-serve Analytics infrastructure for product, product managers, and other employees to perform their own analysis. It provides up-to-date metric definitions, as well as Looker links to pre-filtered jumping off points for modeling the data. This documentation was presented in series of Self-Serve Analytics workshops that were hosted in early June FY22. A recording from the workshop has also been provided below for additional context.

# MLT Metrics

This section outlines metric definitions maintained by finance for reporting to investors. 

1. These are metrics for MLT discussions
   1. Any metrics shared by a department with the MLT will be asked to work with business operations to define the metric to be listed on this page under standardized naming and MLT definition checklist 
2. Definitions center around ARR, GMA Magic Number and NPS

MLT definitions checklist 

1. Qualifiers precede metrics names
   1. i.e. use ""Gross Margin Adjusted Magic Number" instead of "Magic Number, Gross Margin Adjusted" to avoid ambiguity when label names are truncated 
2. Metric names should only have one possible interpretation 
3. All MLT Metrics should have a unique acronym shorter than 8 characters 
   1. Metrics will inevitably be shortened, pre-emptive definition avoids collision
