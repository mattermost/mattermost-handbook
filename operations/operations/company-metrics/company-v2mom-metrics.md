# FY23 Goals Board 

We use Focalboard to track our [company-wide goals](https://community.mattermost.com/boards/workspace/8qt6sh1dzbybb8365caots67iy/b7qzfu3p11f8u9q6mkkfjer4pjr/vmhddhuuz6tbw3bnbou9gkeq8gw). 

This page summarizes our processes and instructions. 

### Instructions for Monthly DRI updates
1. **Go to Goal** - By the 2nd Tuesday of the month, in the left tab, click on [**Goals by DRI**](https://community.mattermost.com/boards/workspace/8qt6sh1dzbybb8365caots67iy/b7qzfu3p11f8u9q6mkkfjer4pjr/vbpoc5xwtm3ddfrz8kz11m38s7o). In the board, scroll to the goals under your initials.
2. **Share Forecast** - Open each goal and update the "forecast" field with your forecast for the end of the period. E.g. For "Q1 Forecast", put in your forecast for Q1 ending number.
3. **Set "Status** - Status is a summary of how you feel progress is going.
- `GREEN` - If you believe you'll hit your target by the end of the period, set status to `Green`.
- `YELLOW/RED` If you feel your target is off-track, but there's still a chance to hit your target, set status to `Yellow`, and if it's way off use `Red`.
- `UNREACHABLE` If you feel it's impossible to reach your goal, set your status to `UNREACHABLE`. Your MLT member will work with you to bring this to the monthly review meeting to discuss how we can adapt as a company.
- `DATA NEEDED` If you don't feel you're able to provide a forecast, or are unsure about anything in the process, set status to `DATA NEEDED`.
4. **Share "Going well" and "Not going well"** - Add a comment to share more context about your goal. Include at least the following:
- `Going Well:` Share wins, successes, and good news in general. Share "Thank yous" to people who have helped, and @mention them if you feel appropriate.
- `Not going well:` Share the key issues you're facing. If the status for the goal is not `Green`, share the key reasons why in this section.
- `Next actions:` Share key actions to be taken in the following month, with owners and checkins. Be specific.
5. **Update the "Last Forecasted"** - Update the field "Last Forecasted" with the date of your forecast so MLX knows it's been completed.
