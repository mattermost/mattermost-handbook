In Q3 we have three goals:

1. 50% VPMOM for company and departments based on our latest thinking
2. Prioritized issues to solve before we lock 99% plan at end of Q4–largely coming from Obstacles in 50% VPMOM
3. After aligning with MLT, begin to discuss 50% VPMOMs with departments to develop into 99% in Q4

Typically there is not pressure for budget or headcount discussions in Q3, focus is strategy.
