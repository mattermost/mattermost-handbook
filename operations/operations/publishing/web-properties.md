\*\* We are exploring Hugo as the system of choice for documentation sites, given it supports advanced search, Markdown language, and a GitHub review process to ensure consistent quality across the site [https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-documentation](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-documentation).

## Information architecture

Below is the tentative top-level information architecture for each of the above domains, work in progress.

See a [more detailed analysis on information architecture recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CaRpCo0Aic-bDIKGtIA5mbtaH7JarCH-3v7rP-SBFHk/edit#) for Docs, Education, Community, and Support.

### handbook.mattermost.com

The handbook is developed with the following structure:

* About Mattermost, including mission, vision, leadership principles, company, and history
* Culture, including our remote-first culture, standards, and MatterCon
* Join Us, including why to work at Mattermost and open positions
* Onboarding, including guides for new staff and managers
* Operations, including mindsets, cadences, metrics, and definitions

### .../docs

Since much software follows recognizable patterns these days, product documentation is shaped into familiar schemas. This often takes the form of product areas/topics, or common use cases.

Thus, information architecture is organized by topic or use case, such as below \(exact architecture yet to be determined\):

* Install and Configuration
* Deployment
* User Management
* System Administration
* Account Settings and Notifications
* Integrations and Plugins
* RESTful API
* Customization

Good examples of this approach include: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs) \| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) \| [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs)

### .../education

Here, the focus is on providing learners access to content by their learning style and provides a mechanism with a currently limited scale of content. It is divided into three categories:

* Guides
* Videos
* Courses

From here, further organization based on themes \(informed by persona use cases\), as content is made available.

Later, as content evolves, content may be based on particular personas and their learning paths.

### .../community

Here, the information architecture is organized by [types of community members](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/community-overview.html), including users and contributors.

A sample architecture for contributors may look like:

* Contributor Process
* Platform and Solution Development, including content in [https://developers.mattermost.com](https://developers.mattermost.com)
* Translations
* Documentation
* etc.

### .../support

No information architecture is yet defined, but in general it will consist of:

* Support Resources \(including peer-to-peer forums\)
* Knowledge Base FAQs

### mattermost.com

The Mattermost website is developed with the following architecture:

* Product, including features and integrations
* Pricing
* Solutions, including use cases
* Case Studies
* Resources, including training and blog
* Docs, including installation and configuration
