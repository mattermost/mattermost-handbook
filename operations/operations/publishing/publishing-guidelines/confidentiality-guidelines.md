# Confidentiality Guidelines

By default, Mattermost defaults to [open actions](../../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#open-actions) for publicly documenting information in a web-discoverable format.

Below is a set of guidelines on what information is considered confidential and should not be published publicly:

* Financial information related to Mattermost, such as revenue and cash, as this may impact potential future funding and IPO.
* Personal information related to staff, customers or community, including residence and full name unless otherwise publicly disclosed.
* Customer information received during support or sales discussions, including customer name unless usage of Mattermost is otherwise publicly disclosed.
* Open discussions about security vulnerabilities, as this may put our users at risk of security attacks.
