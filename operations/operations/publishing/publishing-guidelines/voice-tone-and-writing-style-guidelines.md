# Voice, Tone and Writing Style Guidelines

Below is a start of voice, tone and writing style guidelines for public web properties. This is a work in progress, to be iterated on:

**Voice and Tone**:

* Use simple, plain language that is easy to understand
* Use direct, casual tone instead of an informal tone
* Use the active voice

**Writing Style**:

* Write clearly and concisely - get to the point quickly and concisely without losing valuable information
* Work on the premise that "Every page is page 1", as a large portion of users enters our documentation from a Google search
* Focus on what the target audience wants to accomplish by being practical/outcome-focused
* Break long sections into smaller, easily digestable subpages
* Have at most one key point or action per paragraph
* Use ordered lists or bullets where appropriate, as they are generally easier to read than long blocks of text
* Write for an international audience without idioms or expressions that people outside of your region are unlikely to understand

These guidelines were inspired by [Stripe's knowledge base content](https://document360.io/blog/tear-down-of-stripe-knowledge-base/), which is widely perceived as excellent by the developer community, and [by other sites shared in this Document360 article](https://document360.io/blog/10-knowledge-base-software-best-practice-examples/).
