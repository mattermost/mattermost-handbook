# Voice, Tone and Writing Style Guidelines

Below are a start of voice, tone and writing style guidelines for public web properties to be iterated on:

**Voice and Tone**:
 - Use simple, plain language that is easy to consume
 - Use direct, casual tone instead of an overly informal tone
 - Use the active voice

**Writing Style**:
 - Work on the premise that "Every page is page 1", as a large portion of users enters our documentation from a Google search
 - Get to the point quickly and concisely without losing valuable information
 - Focus on what the target audience wants to accomplish by being practical/outcome-focused
 - Break long sections into smaller, easily digestable subpages
 - Have at most one key point or action per paragraph
 - Use ordered lists or bullets where appropriate, as they are generally easier to read than long blocks of text
 - Write for an international audience without idioms or expressions that people outside of your region are unlikely to understand

These guidelines were inspired by [Stripe's knowledge base content](https://document360.io/blog/tear-down-of-stripe-knowledge-base/), which is widely perceived as excellent by the developer community, and [by other sites shared in this Document360 article](https://document360.io/blog/10-knowledge-base-software-best-practice-examples/).
