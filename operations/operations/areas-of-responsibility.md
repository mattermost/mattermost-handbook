# Areas of Responsibility

[Areas of Responsibility](../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#aor) \(or "AORs"\) map areas of ownership to [Directly Responsible Individuals](../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#dri) \("DRIs"\), Backups \(people to contact when the DRI is on vacation or unavailable\) with a link to a publicly shared Process Write-Up in the Mattermost Handbook, which includes questions and answers to what's been previously asked.

For security reasons, visibility of the AORs is limited to authenticated Mattermost Staff and available in our [AOR directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qraUnYC-4W1W7nouaWzmLKl5zVzKYKqXwkMdBX2t97M/edit#gid=684908004)
