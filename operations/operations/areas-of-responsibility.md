# Areas of Responsibility

[Areas of Responsibility](../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#aor) \(or "AORs"\) map areas of ownership to [Directly Responsible Individuals](../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#dri) \("DRIs"\), Backups \(people to contact when the DRI is on vacation or unavailable\) with a link to a publicly shared Process Write-Up in the Mattermost Handbook, which includes questions and answers to what's been previously asked.
  
For security reasons, visibility of the AORs is limited to authenticated Mattermost Staff and available in GDoc links. If a Team AOR is not listed below, you can reference the original version [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vsx8vTo56tGR6SUcrX_5lTMrEcujJE-MIsKg5o7xiUA/edit#gid=0).
