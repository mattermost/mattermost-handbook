# Getting Started with the Handbook

The Mattermost Handbook is a work-in-progress in that information is constantly being updated, added, revised, and edited.

## Editing the Handbook

The Handbook is open to the public and edits can be submitted by anyone.

## Adding content

You don't need to ask permission to add content to the Handbook. Follow the steps in [How to update the Handbook](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-update-handbook) to get started.

## Questions, suggestions, bugs

If you have an idea for content, you can submit an issue detailing your idea. The more information you provide the better. That said, if you have content ideas why not add it to the Handbook, open a PR, and see where that goes.
