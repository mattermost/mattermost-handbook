## Forecasting

* Forecasting is a weekly process where Sales, CS and Sales Management communicate how much business they will close within a given period, usually the current quarter. 

* Forecasting Definitions:
  * Forecast: "I will close at least this much business this quarter. It is my likely amount I can close."
  * Upside: "There is a chance I will close this much additional business, but don't count on it."

* Forecasting Category Definitions: These categories are assigned based on Opportunity Sales stages in Salesforce.
  * Close: The deal is Closed Won. It is already showing up in Won and Actuals reports. It is not considered part of the Open Pipeline.
  * Commit: Rep is guaranteeing this deal will happen based on the current Opportunity Close Date.
  * Best Case: The deal is looking promising, but cannot commit it will happen on the current Close Date.
  * Pipeline: The deal is in the early stages. Not comfortable forecasting it just yet.
  * Omitted: This deal is Closed Lost.

* Forecast Process. The following are the steps followed in the weekly forecast calls with Sales Managers:
  * In attendance: Sales Manager, Ian, Schiff, and appropriate CSM(s)
  * The Sales Manager drives the call.
  * It is driven off the Sales (Choose Segment) dashboard.
