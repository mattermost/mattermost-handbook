## Sales Definitions

### Market Segmentation

Market Segmentation is based on Total Employee count of the Account.

* Enterprise = 5,000+ total employees
* Mid-Market = 500-4,999 total employees
* SMB (Small Business) = 0-499 total employees

Total Employee count is based on the number of employees that our data tools (Clearbit & DiscoverOrg) return for that account.

### Sales Channel

Sales Channels are ways of bringing products or services to market so that they can be purchased by consumers.

* Sales Serve (Direct) = Sales works directly with the customer to complete the purchase
  * Handheld interaction with Sales that enables more customization for the end customer (payment method, discounting, MSA, etc.)
* Partner/Reseller (Indirect) = Sales works with an approved partner or reseller to complete the purchase
* Self Serve = Customer purchases the product through our [Customer Portal](https://customers.mattermost.com)
  * Allows a high volume of knowledgeable customers to purchase
  * **Self Serve is not synonymous with SMB. Self Serve is a Sales Channel that caters to all market segmentations**

## Forecasting

* Forecasting is a weekly process where Sales, CS and Sales Management communicate how much business they will close within a given period, usually the current quarter. 

* Forecasting Definitions:
  * Forecast: "I will close at least this much business this quarter. It is my likely amount I can close."
  * Upside: "There is a chance I will close this much additional business, but don't count on it."

* Forecasting Category Definitions: These categories are assigned based on Opportunity Sales stages in Salesforce.
  * Close: The deal is Closed Won. It is already showing up in Won and Actuals reports. It is not considered part of the Open Pipeline.
  * Commit: Rep is guaranteeing this deal will happen based on the current Opportunity Close Date.
  * Best Case: The deal is looking promising, but cannot commit it will happen on the current Close Date.
  * Pipeline: The deal is in the early stages. Not comfortable forecasting it just yet.
  * Omitted: This deal is Closed Lost.

* Forecast Process. The following are the steps followed in the weekly forecast calls with Sales Managers:
  * In attendance: Sales Manager, Ian, Elaine, and appropriate CSM(s)
  * The Sales Manager drives the call.
  * It is driven off the Sales (Choose Segment) dashboard.
  * New New (New and Expansion) business
