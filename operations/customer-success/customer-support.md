# Customer Support

Customer Support is a core function at Mattermost with a goal to ensure the success of all customers when using the Mattermost application.

The team is based across three continents to ensure a follow-the-sun approach to working with our customers. They have strong relationships with all parts of the Mattermost organization including, but not limited to, Customer Success, Engineering, and Product Management. These partnerships ensure that issues are addressed quickly and efficiently.

Details of what the Support Team provides for our Enterprise Customers are currently being rewritten and will be updated shortly. This includes our support options and SLAs.
