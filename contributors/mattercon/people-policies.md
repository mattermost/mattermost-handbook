## Job abandonment 

When a staff member is absent from work for three consecutive workdays and there is no entry on the [Time Away Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mattermost.com_mg3nulgf6e70e50ohlq2rrkcnc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) or a post in the [Stand-Up Channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up) noting the time off, and fails to contact their manager or HR, they can be terminated for job abandonment unless otherwise required by local law.

A manager will notify HR if they are unable to reach a direct report within a 24-hour period of the above criteria. HR may then access a staff member's contact information, including emergency contact information, to attempt additional reach out.
