For questions about tickets, schedule, events, and anything else visit the MatterCon2021 Community channel or ping @hanna.park directly.

## Community engagement information

We'll have multiple opportunities for staff members to engage with the community on June 24th, our official Community Day.

1. Submit AMA questions for our top contributor panel [here](https://forms.gle/FGpmm7DhvrciQqgr7).
2. Sign up to be a Community Buddy [here](https://forms.gle/FGpmm7DhvrciQqgr7).

### What's expected of a Community Buddy?

A Community Buddy is an internal staff member who's paired up with a member of our community. We'll default to pairing people up based on time zones to be most convenient for them. However if there's a specific community member you'd like to work with, please indicate that on the form above.

You'll be expected to reach out to them via Mattermost to let them know that you're their buddy, and that you'll be available throughout the event in case they have any questions, comments, etc. If you're not the right person to answer their questions, it will be your responsibility to reach out to the correct person, and make sure they connect back with your buddy. We'll also expect you to engage with them throughout the event (via Mattermost) periodically, so that they feel as welcomed and included as possible.

## Community VR tips and tricks

### Staying charged up

(@aaron.rothschild) If you have a MacBook, use its USB-C charging cord with your Oculus if you're running low on batteries in a pinch. It's much longer than the cord that comes with your Oculus Headset. Also, you can plug that USB-C cord from your Oculus into your MacBook to give additional range from the plug in your wall. There's also in the experimental settings area, a way to set your "real Desk" so it is picked up by the Oculus and shows an outline of your standing desk in a virtual world so you don't bump into it. This helps so I can place the controllers down or lean my hands on my desk while in a virtual meeting.
