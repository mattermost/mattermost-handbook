# Recruiting

## Hiring in existing U.S. States

We support hiring in the following U.S. states:

* CA CO FL IN KS MA MD MI MO NJ NV NY OH OK PE SC TN TX UT VA WA WI

## Hiring in new U.S. States

Each time we hire in a new U.S. state we may be subject to new regulations, taxes, and reporting obligations and we need time to prepare for compliant operations in new states ahead of doing business in state, which begins when we employ a new hire.

For U.S. states not on the above list, the recruiting team should provide at least 3 weeks' notice ahead of a potential offer signing date that a new state would be added.

To add a new U.S. state please DM @tim.quock to provide the Finance team with advance notice and confirm if a lead time of more than 3 weeks may be needed.

## We are not yet able to hire in the following regions/countries

We're continuing to find ways to hire in more regions/countries. These regions/countries are more difficult than others:

Brazil, Iran, Russian Federation, China, Syria, Lebanon, North Korea

## As Appropriate Interviews \("AA"s\)

To ensure the quality bar and culture of Mattermost is strong and rising, an "As Appropriate" interview is required with a senior, tenured Mattermost staff member for any FTE candidate before an offer can be extended.

Typically the AA is the last person on the interview loop and scheduled in advance and cancelled if the candidate doesn't get through the loop--i.e. an AA interview should not slow down the interview process.

The following list of people are approved as As Appropriate interviewers \(aka "AA"s\):

* Ian Tien, CEO and co-founder
* Corey Hulen, CTO and co-founder 

Each AA interviewer should have at least 3 reserved slots per week available for AA interviews, ideally in different timezone ranges, providing capacity for 12 new hires per month per AA.

### Checklist for As Appropriate Interview

24 hours before an [AA interview](recruiting.md#as-appropriate-interviews-aa-s), the Lever record for the candidate should include:

1. Hire/No Hire feedback from everyone on the interview loop
2. Attachments of any work product produced during the interview loop
3. Any open questions from interviewers that has not been covered 
4. Notes on any backchannel references completed. For any confidential feedback please use SECRET NOTE with mention to the AA and leave out the name of the source
