## Working and Meeting Across the Globe

### Remote First

We’re headquartered in Palo Alto, California and, like many open source companies, Mattermost's staff and contributors are widely geographically located. We run as a distributed, high performance, and high trust team using a few principles:

#### 1. Work Anywhere with Good Internet

Working from anywhere means more time with loved ones, no commute, and controlling everything about your workspace.

The one requirement is having the ability to occassionally [join video calls using Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-Requirements-for-PC-Mac-and-Linux) between 8am and 1pm California time, which requires a good enough internet connection.

Recommended download/upload speeds should be 8 Mbps/512 kbps for smooth group calling and screensharing, with a bare minimum of 4 Mbps/128 kbps. The [Ookla Speed Test](https://www.speedtest.net/) can be used to check your internet speed.

There are exceptions to this requirement, for example: part-time roles that don’t need to take meetings, or roles providing support outside core meeting hours. Hiring Managers and Recruiters will indicate any time zone requirements for specific roles and/or teams.

We are continually expanding where we can hire staff, updated lists can be found [here](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us).

#### 2. Be Clear and Precise

Working in a distributed organization means it may take time before a person reads your message and responds, so make sure you are clear.

Communicate relevant information in the first message:

* Avoid “Are you free to talk?” and “Can we talk about something at 3pm?”, instead use “Can we speak about ulimit issue Customer X is having?”

Write unambiguously:

* Avoid “I think the answer is Yes”, instead use “Yes”, “No”, or “I think the answer is Yes, I’ll confirm with Steve and let you know.”

Likewise, we emphasize written communication. Reading is faster than listening and it reaches more people, which means more happens in less time.

#### 3. Take Ownership

Own the outcomes of your work: When working on problems, requests, and feedback always be clear about next steps, and either drive the resolution or create a ticket to track the work. Communicate blindspots and help your teammates understand potential [Brown M&Ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms)

#### 4. Make Meaningful Connections

We have [warm-ups](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/mattermost-communication#ice-breaker) in some meetings to learn more about each other. It’s part of our culture where we get to know each other.

Find time after meetings and video conferences to get to know your teammates. Ask them about their weekends and how their life is outside of work.

When you meet in person at off-sites and events, build on those relationships.

#### 5. Be the Change You Want to See

When something isn't clearly documented, take the initiative to figure out what's going on, and update the documentation for the people who come after you.

[Learn, Master, Teach](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#learn-master-teach) is a model we use to pass on training after you’ve been trained to help grow everyone at the company.

### Meetups

We have Meetups around the world to deepen and broaden our relationships and build the future of our products together.

### Interview Process

We can hire from many countries and regions across the globe. While in-office interviews typically go through 1 - 3 interview rounds, our candidates and interviewers may be located in various timezones and therefore each interview is scheduled separately.

## Interview Stages

As a fully remote and global team, Mattermost interviewers are located in different time zones. Since we also interview candidates across different time zones, we schedule interviews one-on-one as opposed to a panel of interviews on one specific date. Below are the typical stages and number of interviewers a candidate can expect in a full interview process at Mattermost.

All interviews take place over video (using Zoom). Interviewers will wait 5 minutes for a candidate to join before leaving the interview. We encourage candidates to email their recruiting contact and the Mattermost interviewer if they are not able to make a scheduled interview.

1. **Recruiter Screen:** This is a candidate's main point of contact during the interview process at Mattermost. For some roles, Hiring Managers may incorporate a recruiter screen within their first interview with a candidate.
2. **Hiring Manager, Technical, and Team Interviews:** This portion typically consists of 3-4 interviewers. In addition to the Hiring Manager, candidates can expect to interview with team and cross-team members who will work closely with, or similarly to, the individual in this role.
3. **Interview Project:** All take-home projects will list the expected amount of time expected to complete. We really appreciate all of the time spent completing a take-home project. As a 'thank you,' candidates will be invited to select a gift option upon completion of the project.
4. **Final Interviews:** This typically includes the Hiring Team's [MLT](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#mlt) and one of our co-founders. **Note:** For Director and above interviews, both Mattermost co-founders will interview candidates.
5. **Final Decision:** A member of the Hiring Team will reach out to you to let you know our decision.

We hope that you have a great experience interviewing at Mattermost and welcome any feedback you may have. We may invite candidates to share feedback about our interview process so we may continually improve the process and experience.

## Reference Checks and Offer Stage

Candidates will receive a verbal offer to join Mattermost. Upon verbal acceptance, the hiring team will send the contract paperwork to the new candidate. Offer letters will be signed internally first: 
- [CAO to initial](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/company-agreements#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos) as the first signer.
- The prospective staff member will be the third and final signer.

Reference checks are typically done through [SkillSurvey](https://www.skillsurvey.com/reference-checking-solution/) or a Hiring Manager may decide to conduct references on their own. Candidates will be informed of reference type ahead of providing references. All contracts are contingent on the successful and satisfactory completion of reference checks.

### General Benefits

**Flexible Hours**

Results matter far more than hours in an office. Your time at Mattermost is flexible. Go see the dentist, visit a friend, walk your dog – no need to ask permission.

For most roles, we require the ability to join meetings between 8am and 1pm California time. The exception is people who are dedicated to support in other timezones, or team members that don’t need to be in real-time discussions.

**Paid Time Off and Holidays**

Just as flexible as our working hours, learn about our [paid time off and holidays policy and process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off).

#### Frequently Asked Questions

**Are there core hours that I'll be expected to work?**

We have a weekly all-company [Customer Obsession Meeting](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-com). We understand staff may not be able to attend every week. The meeting is 25 minutes and a recording is shared internally for staff that may not be able to attend. There may be team-specific schedule requirements depending on the team and role, such as teams with SLAs or on-call requirements. Your Recruiter or Hiring Manager will indicate any specific team core hours during the interview process.
