#### Exploring Mattermost as a wrkplace

Mattermost is a remote-first company, and staff work from locations ranging from their home office to shared workspaces. Our headquarters is on the internet - specifically, we work on an open test server called [https://pre-release.mattermost.com](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/) which runs a pre-released version of Mattermost software with all the newest features and improvements \(which is occassionally unstable\). The server is integrated with Zoom and employees and staff members can launch voice, video, and screensharing meetings within Mattermost.

Preparing to hire an employee in a new state takes time, and we may be subject to new regulations, taxes, and reporting obligations. If a candidate is progressing in the interview process and would be living and working from a U.S. state not listed above, the Recruiter will DM @tim.quock and @natalie.jew with the state and the title of the position the candidate may fill at least three weeks prior to an anticipated offer.

**Joining the test server**

If you’re thinking of joining Mattermost as an open source contributor, as an employee or staff contributor, or as an ecosystem partner, we welcome you to create an account on our server and see what it’s like to work here.

When you join, please use the username `firstname.lastname` so it’s easier to get to know you. You can create a new account from here: [https://community.mattermost.com/signup_user_complete](https://community.mattermost.com/signup_user_complete) \(select Email and Password\).

A bot will suggest different channels for you to view, and you’re welcome to join any channel on the server. All the information you’ll have access to is public \(employees and staff have confidential channels and workspaces on the server\).

**Say “Hello”**

If you’re in contact with someone with an `@mattermost.com` email address, such as a recruiter or hiring manager, you can message them or your hiring manager on the server by contacting them at `firstname.lastname` to let them know if you have joined.

**Try some formatting**

To practice sending messages in Mattermost, particularly around formatting, you can send messages to yourself to test out how messages will look before sending to another person.

### Referral progam

### FAQ

#### Do you offer internships?

We don’t currently offer internships. If you’re interested in expanding your experiences and resume, please consider joining our [open source community](https://mattermost.com/contribute).

#### I’m interested in a staff position, how do I get noticed?

If you haven’t yet experienced the product, you should do that as a first step by joining [our Community server](https://community.mattermost.com).

When you apply there’s a question about your experience with Mattermost and at a minimum you should have spent some time using the product and have some opinions on what you like and what we might improve.

If you are technical, we hire about 70% of our R&D staff from our open source community. If you want to increase your odds further, please consider trying a beginner or intermediate [open source contribution](https://mattermost.com/contribute/).

#### I’m an agency or contingent recruiter and I have a candidate for you

Thank you for thinking of us. In general, we don’t work with agency or contingent recruiters unless they are referred from people we know who can vouch for success in working with you.

Unless you fit this criteria, we would ask you remove us from your mailing list.
