There are a few ways to [join Mattermost](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us#join-us). This page is intended to give candidates an overview of our interview process. Thank you for your interest in joining Mattermost! 

### Typical Interview Process
These are the typical stages of the interview process. 

#### Applicant Questionnaire
Applicants will be asked a set of standard and role-specific questions as part of the candidate application. Candidates that have been reached out to from  Recruiting or Hiring Manager teams will be asked to complete these questions as part of the first interview schedule. The answers are kept within the candidate's lever profile. 

#### [Recruiter Screen](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting#recruiter-screen-optional)
The Recruiter for each role will conduct the first candidate interview. The screen includes standard Mattermost questions and specific questions to assess the candidate's experience, skillset and mindset. The Recruiter will also share an overview of the [Mattermost Leadership Principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-onboarding-guide#leadership-principles). Candidates are encouraged to ask any questions about the role, team and Mattermost. 

#### Interview Panel
The Hiring Manager will interview as part of the first interview panel. This panel also includes 3-4 team members that are either team members on the direct team or cross-team members that this role will work closely with. Each interviewer will have distinct focus areas for their portion of the interview. 

#### Interview Project 
Most roles at Mattermost will include a take-home project as part of the interview process. Projects are typically assigned after the 2nd or 3rd intervewer, including Recruiter Screen. 

**Getting Started with the Project**
All projects will list the expected amount of time to complete the project. This is intended to help provide each candidate with clarity on timing expectations. Your Recruiter and Hiring Manager will give more information about the specific project. Your Recruiter may ask you to sign an agreement ahead of the interview project. You'll only be asked to sign one of the following forms: 

1. The [Contributor Licence Agreement](https://mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) ("CLA") will be required to sign if your take-home project takes part in our [Mattermost Community](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us#open-source-contributors). 
2. The [NDA agreement](https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=75563bac-a0ac-4aef-a434-06d9c33c1f90&env=na3&acct=e5bb8810-00ab-47c2-af80-9d331c19377f&v=2) may be required to sign if your take-home project does not require the CLA to be signed. Your Recruiter will confirm this step. 

**Gift Card Options** 
Mattermost recognizes and appreciates that Candidates spend personal time to complete this project. To share our appreciation, candidates will recieve a Thank You gift card upon completion of the interview project. Candidates can choose from a variety of gift cards, including: Apple iTunes, Google Plan, eBay, Visa Gift Card.
