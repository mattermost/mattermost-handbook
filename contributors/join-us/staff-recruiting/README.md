# Staff Recruiting

In order to continually increase what we offer to customers we need to continually source, assess, hire and onboard new staff members. The below outlines the process for recruiting new staff into the company. 

## Role Description 

Role descriptions should have clear responsibilities and requirements for each role that a recruiter can use to filter candidates and interviews can use to assess the candidate's fit for the role. 

**Responsibilities:** 

* What will the candidates need to do be successful in their role in our culture \(e.g. hire and manage team building new product line\)? 
* What will the interview panel be interviewing for in their meetings? 

**Requirements:** 

* What you want recruiters to screen for in providing candidates? 
* What will you want your interview panel to verify in terms of core capabilities \(e.g. ability to hire and manage a remote-first team, etc.\)? 

## Pre-Meet Scores \(Optional\) 

In the selection process prior to meeting candidates, hiring managers face two big challenges: 

* **Too much volume** - Too many applications and resumes potentially qualified for the job description 
* **Not enough clarity** - It's easy to miss amazing talent that doesn't have a well-written resume \(a lot of top talent doesn't need to look for jobs, they just get referred by people who worked with them before\) 

Because of this, we offer hiring managers a framework for summarizing a potential candidate's background ahead of meeting them \(i.e. a "pre-meet score"\), which can be completed by recruiters, by candidate screeners or by the candidate themselves. 

There are multiple pre-meet scores: 

* **Company pre-meet score:** A score to help identify candidates that may have advantages in succeeding in our culture or in advantages to the company in increasing our ability to connect with underrepresented talent pools \(international experience, different gender identities, educational backgrounds, etc.\) 
* **Department pre-meet score:** Each department may have its own criteria used in recruiting screens to provide an additional pre-meet score in addition to the company pre-meet score.
