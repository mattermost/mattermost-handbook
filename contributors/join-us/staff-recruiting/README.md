# Staff Recruiting

In order to continually increase what we offer to customers we need to continually source, assess, hire and onboard new staff members with [high standards](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-onboarding-guide#leadership-principles). The below outlines the process for recruiting new staff into the company.  

## How to Open a New Role 
Hiring Managers should confirm with your Team's MLT that your new headcount requisition has been approved. If not, your MLT team member should work with the Director of HR and VP Finance and Operations to gain approval. 

## Role Description 

Once you have confirmation that your new headcount has been approved, you’re ready to begin the recruitment process. Complete the [Job Description portion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rpTI2NKu4H_781vpx_eD9Fku7go4gGDs1P7bJAMQvAU/edit#) and share with your Recruiter, who will schedule a [Recruiter In-Take Session](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/join-us/staff-recruiting/Recruiting Cadences) to review the remainder of the in-take template. 

Your Recruiter will be based on the role and team. This may differ depending on Recruiting Team bandwidth, and will be communicated on a case-by-case basis.

* All others -- Natalie Jew 

### Role Leveling 

You can view the current [v1 Job Levels here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kNsl7JUWDQ8MhWonys9dR3osrxEWYkKVIoECfFKSQzw/edit#gid=0). Note: HR is also working with MLT to build v2 which will help provide additional clarity. If you are unsure about how to use or assign a level to a new job req, your recruiter can help you walk through this as part of the Recruiter In-Take. 

### Ideal Candidate Profile (ICP) 

The ICP should be a clear list of key skills, experiences and/or mindsets that the Hiring Manager believes represent the Ideal Candidate. The Hiring Manager will be asked to stack rank the ICP list and use ‘P0’ to indicate "must haves" and 'P1' to indicate "nice to have" the ideal skills, experiences and mindsets. 

The ICP will be used to align the sourcing, interview panel focus areas and onboarding goals for this new role. For example, here’s an ICP for a [Lead Customer Journey Engineer](https://jobs.lever.co/mattermost/3c1dd4ff-b135-4bb7-8b14-73c4a8cd674f). The list below reflects the top skills and experience to source for candidates, the area of focus for the interview panel and what the eventual new hire's onboarding goals will be based on.  

P0 - 2+ Years experience leading a team of engineers
P1 - Experience as an Engineer or a Lead for a team doing front-end/UI-UX work in JavaScript, React, etc.

### Changing the ICP 

The ICP is also a helpful indicator of talent pools. If a role is not gaining enough candidate pipeline or the candidate fit is off, the ICP enables Hiring Managers to efficiently determine appropriate tradeoffs as it relates to the P0 or P1 skills, experience and mindsets. For example, a Recruiter may find that we have filtered multiple candidates who do not have a specific P0 skill. As a result, a Hiring Manager may determine that it may be worth deprioritizing a specific qualification from P0 to P1 in order to widen the candidate pool. If an ICP is ever changed, the Recruiter will ensure that the hiring team is aligned to the change. 

## Pre-Interview Screens
Hiring Managers will review the Pre-Interview Screening process during the Recruiter In-Take Session. 

### Resume Screen 

Hiring Managers will review resumes and tag their Recruiter in Lever to indicate interest in a candidate. Hiring Managers can review Candidates that are in the Shortlist or New Lead stage. 

The Recruiter will also archive Candidates that are located in regions we are not able to hire or do not match the location target of the role. 

### Post-Application Candidate Questions \(Optional\) 

This is an optional step, but is highly recommended to improve candidate & job match ahead of any reach out. Hiring Managers can create a set of questions that every candidate will be asked to complete either as part of the application process or before the Recruiter Screen. 

### Recruiter Screen \(Optional\) 

Hiring Managers can customize the questions asked during the Recruiter screen or they may decide to remove this stage and handle the first screen themselves. The purpose of this screen is to:
* Have one main point of contact throughout the interview process 
* Collect compensation requirements and verify location of residence 
* Provide the candidate with more information on: Mattermost, the role, the recruiting process, and to understand the candidate’s: timeline, role/career aspirations, assess interest, compensation expectations and answer questions.
* Hiring Managers can also request the Recruiter to ask specific questions as part of the Recruiter Screen. Hiring Managers can decide the set of questions during the Recruiter in-take.

## Pre-Meet Scores \(Optional\) 

In the selection process prior to meeting candidates, hiring managers face two big challenges: 

* **Too much volume** - Too many applications and resumes potentially qualified for the job description 
* **Not enough clarity** - It's easy to miss amazing talent that doesn't have a well-written resume \(a lot of top talent doesn't need to look for jobs, they just get referred by people who worked with them before\) 

Because of this, we offer hiring managers a framework for summarizing a potential candidate's background ahead of meeting them \(i.e. a "pre-meet score"\), which can be completed by recruiters, by candidate screeners or by the candidate themselves. 

There are multiple pre-meet scores: 

* **Company pre-meet score:** A score to help identify candidates that may have advantages in succeeding in our culture or in advantages to the company in increasing our ability to connect with underrepresented talent pools \(international experience, different gender identities, educational backgrounds, etc.\) 
* **Department pre-meet score:** Each department may have its own criteria used in recruiting screens to provide an additional pre-meet score in addition to the company pre-meet score. 

### Company Pre-Meet Score 

Company pre-meet scores are as follows: 

#### Community Experience

## Interview Process 

Interview panels and the order of interviewers will be determined by the Hiring Manager during the Recruiter In-Take. Ahead of the first interview for a new req, the Recruiter will send the Interview Team a summary of the Interview Plan, including each Interviewer's Focus Area(s). Hiring Manager will also indicate the Interview Mid-Point which will also drive the Mid-Interview Syncs. 

For the purpose of a positive candidate experience and efficient use of mana, it's recommended that there be no more than 4 non-Hiring Manager and non-MLT interviewers. Ultimately, the Hiring Manager will decide how many interviewers are needed. 

### Interview Panel Process
As part of the In-take Session, the Recruiter will also work with the Hiring Manager to define the scope and focus area(s) for each interviewer using the ICP. Ahead of the first candidate interview, the Recruiter will post an update in the Recruiting Updates Channel and tag the Interview Panel. The update will include  the scope and focus area(s) for each interviewer. To promote [high standards](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-onboarding-guide#leadership-principles) hiring, if 2+ interviewers are not a **Strong Yes** ahead of the mid-sync, the candidate will not move forward. 

**Interview Panel SLAs**
In order to expedite the recruiting process for each candidate, please follow the feedback timeline:
1. Interviewers should submit their 1-4 rating in Lever within 1 hour of the interview completion. 
2. Interviews should submit their full summary feedback within 24 hours of the interview. 

**Tips on Sharing Candidate Feedback** 
* Required: Lever’s 1-4 rating on the candidate 
* Clearly state your opinion on how this candidate ranks compared to other candidates interviewed as it relates to your focus area. This should be objective and simple. For example: Strong Yes for SRE, but not quite as technical in Kubernetes as John Doe. 
* Feedback on the specific skill/focus area assigned with examples to help contextualize your rating  
* Potential [blindspots](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#shoulder-check) or [brown m&ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms) that may require either a future interviewer to ask about or the Hiring Manager to cover during a reference check.

### Interview project
Candidates may be asked to complete a project as part of the interview process. Hiring Managers will indicate this need during the in-take. Hiring Managers can create their own project. Reach out to Recruiting for sample projects. 

All take home projects should list the expected amount of time to complete. This provides candidates with expectation clarity. The Hiring Manager will indicate which stage of the recruiting process a take home will be given. The process for this stage will be standard for all roles: 

1. Hiring Manager or Recruiter will inform the candidate of the Take Home project details and ask the candidate to complete either: 
 * [CLA](https://mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/)if the Take Home project is a Community Ticket 
 * NDA if the above doesn’t apply 
2. Hiring Manager or Recruiter will send the candidate the Take Home instructions through Lever. 
3. Upon completion, the Hiring Manager or Recruiter will complete the [Interview Project Gift Card Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMppjsYmEyrMmY3tXnKdAs_cvA21o0vHRcyuVN6uFOoU3_Eg/viewform) which will notify the People Team to send a Thank You gift to the candidate for completing the project. 

## Offer Stage

### Reference Checks 
WIP 

### Offer Approval Process 
Once reference checks are complete and an offer is ready to be made. The Recruiter will enter in the offer information in Lever for approval. 

The order of approval will follow: 
1. HR Director 
2. MLT team member 
3. VP, Finance & Operations 
4. CEO 

After offer approval, the Recruiter, Team MLT or AA Interview will extend a verbal offer to the candidate. Upon verbal acceptance, the Director of HR will send the offer letter. 

### Extending an Offer 

Recruiting will typically extend an offer, unless otherwise determined by the MLT team member or Hiring Manager. Exceptions may be made if the Team MLT memberor AA Interviewer prefers to extend the offer. 

### Sending an Offer & Notifying Internal Teams 
This process will be managed by HR. 

1. Once an offer is approved, the Recruiter will select the appropriate offer template based on candidates’s residence region and send for signatures. 
2. Upon full execution of a new Staff contract, the Recruiter will mark the candidate as “hired” in Lever and export the profile to BambooHR. 
3. Once exported to BambooHR, an automatic New Starter Notification will be sent to the Hiring Team to kick-off the onboarding process. 

### Pre-Onboarding Process
New Colleagues will receive pre-onboarding instructions from the People team. Hiring Managers will also receive a request to indicate new systems for their new direct report. 
* The Recruiter will share the ICP with HR as part of the Offer Request. 
* Hiring Managers should review the role ICP with the new hire during Onboarding to help align new colleagues to the role’s focus areas and help contextualize a new colleague’s priorities as they ramp-up with the team and their new peers.
