This section details all of the different ways the Recruiting communicates and at what cadence. Hiring Managers will play an active role in each cadence. 

## Recruiting Updates

**Hiring Managers Mattermost Channel** 
MLT, Recruiting and any current Hiring Manager should join the Hiring Managers Channel. The purpose of the channel is to asynchronously communicate important recruiting updates and dive deeper into recruiting topics or challenges with specific roles.  

**Weekly Recruiting Update**
Recruiting will share a Metrics Update in the Hiring Managers Channel (TBD) every Monday morning by 10 AM Palo Alto Time. 

**Topics Covered**  
* Candidate Pipeline: this will be a stack rank of number of candidates, number of candidates that convert to a Recruiter or Hiring Manager Screen 
* Pipeline Metrics: this includes metrics for each stage of the interview process by role, by priority of role (P0, P1, P2) 
* ICP Alignment: this will be based on candidates that are rejected at any point after a Recruiting or Hiring Manager Screen 
* What's Going Well: roles that are on target to be filled within 90 days, roles on track to the Mid-Interview milestone or MLT,AA Interviews
* What's Not Going Well: roles that are not on target to be filled within 90 days, roles that have little traction 

## Recruiter In-Take Session 

Your Recruiter will schedule an in-take session after youâ€™ve completed your Job Description. During this call, your Recruiter will work with you to ensure alignment on the level, ideal candidate profile, application and recruiter screening questions, the interview process and next steps. 

## Mid-Interview Sync
Ahead of MLT and AA interviews, the Recruiter may schedule a live mid-interview sync to align on intent to move forward and any ICP criteria that need additional assessment.  If there are multiple candidates in the pipe, the Recruiter may ask the interview panel to rank the candidate pool. This exercise helps clear any potential blindspots or confusion around role expectations. It also allows the Recruiting team to prioritize the highest ranking candidates to complete the interview process, as appropriate

**Logistics**
* Mid-interview sync will be pre-scheduled to occur after the last mid-interviewer completes. 
* If there are multiple candidates for the same role, the sync may be scheduled after all candidates have gone through the last mid-interviewer. 
* If you are an interviewer and cannot make the scheduled sync, please make sure to submit complete feedback in Lever ahead of the scheduled sync.
