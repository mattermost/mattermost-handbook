# Agency Onboarding

This document provides information around working with Mattermost if you are an agency.

## ICP (Ideal candidate profile)

The Recruiter will send you the ICP for the role once we are ready to kick off the opening. This is a document filled by each Hiring Manager with detailed information. This is for internal use only - please don't share this file with the candidates.
 
## Application questions

When submitting a candidate provide the answers to these application questions (for all roles):

- Why are you applying for this position at Mattermost (other than it being a remote position)?
- On a scale of 1 (not a fit) to 10 (perfect fit) how would you rate your potential fit for the role for which you're applying?
- Please tell us why you've chosen such a rating?
- Have you used Mattermost previously or contributed to the open source project? If so, please tell us the ways you've been involved.
- Experience working at open source software companies.

### Role-related questions

Each of the openings have their own application questions. You can find them on the ICP. Please send the answers along with the candidate´s resume. Make sure to send the original resume not an agency-customized one.

## Hiring across the globe

We currently support hiring in the following countries/regions:

Australia, Canada, Chile, Finland, Georgia, Germany, India, Mauritius, Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States

We are constantly working towards adding more countries/regions to this list, but it takes a lot of time and resources. This list will be updated as we are able to hire in additional countries/regions. Due to local laws, there may be restrictions on which types of roles we can hire in each country/region.

We currently have staff in the following U.S. states:

AZ CA CO FL GA IN KS MA MD MI MO NC NJ NV NY OK SC TN TX UT VA WA WI

Preparing to hire an employee in a new state takes time, and we may be subject to new regulations, taxes, and reporting obligations. If a candidate is progressing in the interview process and would be living and working from a U.S. state not listed above, the Recruiter will DM finance with the state and the title of the position the candidate may fill at least three weeks prior to an anticipated offer.

# How to communicate with Mattermost

Once a contract has been signed, agencies will be invited to join our Mattermost Community and Lever, our Applicant Tracking System. These two systems are the easiest and most ideal method to communicate because it helps maintain a high-level of collaboration and feedback with our Mattermost hiring team, including specific Hiring Managers.

## Sign up to Mattermost

In order to facilitate communication, we would like you to join our Community. We will create a channel for you, the Hiring Manager, Natalie Jew (HR Director), and Teresa Novoa (Recruiting Manager) to interact there. At first, we will try to calibrate the potential candidates you may have. Then, as you will have access to Lever (our ATS), you will first upload candidates there and then ping us on Mattermost anytime if you have any further questions around them. Please keep all the conversation in that channel.

Go to https://community.mattermost.com, sign up, and join the Contributors channel to ask questions. Once you've joined, please ping me (teresa.novoa).
 
## Lever

You should have an invite on your inbox. We hope you find it very intuitive and easy to use but let us know if you need help.
 
**Important note:** Make sure to add the candidate´s location and email address. We will handle the communication with them, and you will be automatically cc´d in all the email exchanges.
 
## Salary information

Please send your recruiter a separate email with the candidate's salary expectations (gross p/year). We only use email and Lever to share candidate salary information. Please help us keep this type of data **confidential**. Your Recruiter will let you know if expected salary is within range ahead of proceeding with any internal interviews.
