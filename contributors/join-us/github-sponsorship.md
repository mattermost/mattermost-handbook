# Mattermost GitHub Sponsorship

Mattermost participates in the GitHub sponsorship program to help empower our key contributors and sponsor them for 1 year. It is primarily intended for recognition on the work that the selected contributors have done.

[GitHub Sponsors](https://docs.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-github-sponsors) allows the developer community to financially support the people and organizations who design, build, and maintain the open source projects they depend on, directly on GitHub.

## Who is eligible?

_Mattermost GitHub sponsorship_ is considered for [MVP](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/mvp/)-like contributors \("Most Valued Professional"\) in any of the [available regions](https://github.com/sponsors) supported by GitHub.

## Process outline

1. A Mattermost staff member recommends a contributor for sponsorship and writes a short motivation to support their recommendation. This should be addressed to their direct manager as well as the program lead.
2. [MLT](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#mlt) senior leader approves the recommendation and notifies the program lead.
3. Program lead sends a request to ap@mattermost.com to approve the sponsorship.
4. Program lead informs the contributor of the nomination. Once the contributor has accepted it \(by simply replying to the notice\), the sponsorship is processed and appears in the contributor's GitHub profile.

## Notes

* Continued sponsorship will be evaluated quarterly.
* The current program lead is Carrie Warner.
