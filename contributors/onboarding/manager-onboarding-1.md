# Manager Onboarding - 1%

## People Manager Approvals

1. **Managing and approving.** [Time Off](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off#communicating-time-off). Our culture is high trust and results-focused. We want people to take time away to relax, think and come back energized and willing to bring their best self to work. As a people manager, it is important to consistently iterate and define what [vacation-ready](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/working-at-mattermost#5-be-the-change-you-want-to-see) means for your team. All time-off requests should be recorded in BambooHR. 
2. **Location change requests.** Staff agreements are conditioned upon the region of residence noted in a staff member's contract. Location change requests should be discussed with [HR](mailto:%20hr@mattermost.com) and your MLT member prior to providing written approval. Staff must receive written approval from the Company prior to a region relocation. 
3. **Contract approvals.** If you'd like to engage with a new external partner/vendor/customer or are updating terms, confirm who should be the [Contract Accountability Owner](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-agreements#what-are-e-sign-completion-expectations) and follow e-sign process. 
   1. [U.S. Consultant Agreement Template](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/risk-management/mattermost-templated-agreements#mattermost-u-s-consulting-agreements)
   2. [Procure a Vendor](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#procuring-a-vendor)
4. **Accounting and Finance Approvals:** 
   * Staff expense reimbursement: Managers will need to approve their team's  [expenses](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#when-approving-an-expense-report). Any expense reimbursement questions should be routed to the [Purchases Channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases). 
   * Placeholder - invoices
5. **Headcount and Offer Approvals.** \(MLT-specific\).[ See Hiring Workflow](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people#key-channels-and-resources). MLT and Directors should also reference the [Hiring Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ApYjf13A-ji9gvr13EIxGet6iMwfGo9YWYkVuDsiumA/edit#gid=355968799) to review approved open requisitions. 

## People Managers **Responsibilities -** People Programs

### **Onboarding**

We strive to provide a smooth onboarding experience that enables new colleagues into a safe and compliant working environment with a strong sense of belonging. Managers should familiarize themselves with onboarding in order to appropriately fill in any gaps for their new team member.

* Complete the [department onboarding template](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-on-boarding-guide#departmental-onboarding-checklists) prior to your new staff member's start date. 
* Assign an Onboarding Peer \(Link w/ description to come\). Managers should ask permission of a potential Onboarding Peer prior to assignment. 
* 60 - Day New Hire Review \(Link with description to come\). Managers will need to select the 4-6 peers to provide peer review feedback. 

### **Performance Management**

* **Performance Reviews.** Managers will be invited to a [High Output Management Managers Session](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/performance-reviews-50#high-output-management) ahead of writing a Performance Evaluation. Managers will need to read the [required chapter](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/performance-reviews-50#high-output-management) of High Output Management ahead of the Session. The book is also a part of the [Additional Training Resources](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#additional-training-resources) recommended for new Managers. It's suggested to read the book during onboarding or upon becoming a manager at Mattermost. 
* **Performance Feedback.** Communicating explicitly is key in managing remote staff and teams and feedback is one of the most important tools a manager has to set individuals and teams up for success. 
  * Managers should address [Brown M&Ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms) and [Likes and Wishes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes) in a timely manner to ensure expectations are aligned and to maintain asynchronous communication.  
  * [People Partners](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people#team) can help provide coaching and feedback on how to approach performance issues.
