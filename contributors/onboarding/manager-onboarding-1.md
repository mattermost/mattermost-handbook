## People Manager Approvals

1. **Managing and approving:** [Time Off](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off#communicating-time-off). Our culture is high trust and results-focused. We want people to take time away to relax, think and come back energized and willing to bring their best self to work. As a people manager, it is important to consistently iterate and define what [vacation-ready](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/working-at-mattermost#5-be-the-change-you-want-to-see) means for your team. All time-off requests should be recorded in BambooHR.
2. **Location change requests:** Staff agreements are conditioned upon the country/region of residence noted in a staff member's contract. Location change requests should be discussed with [HR](mailto:%20hr@mattermost.com) and your MLT member prior to providing written approval. Staff must receive written approval from the Company prior to a country/region relocation.
3. **Contract approvals:** To engage with a new external partner/vendor/customer or are to update terms, the [Contract Accountability Owner](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-agreements#what-are-e-sign-completion-expectations) should follow the appropriate process:
   1. [U.S. Consultant Agreement Template](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/risk-management/mattermost-templated-agreements#mattermost-u-s-consulting-agreements)
   2. [Procure a Vendor](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract#procuring-a-vendor)
4. **Accounting and Finance Approvals:**
   * Staff expense reimbursement: Managers will need to approve their team's  [expenses](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#when-approving-an-expense-report). Any expense reimbursement questions should be routed to the [Purchases Channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases).
   * Placeholder - invoices
5. **Headcount and Offer Approvals:** \(MLT-specific\).[ See Hiring Workflow](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people#key-channels-and-resources). MLT and Directors should also reference the [Hiring Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ApYjf13A-ji9gvr13EIxGet6iMwfGo9YWYkVuDsiumA/edit#gid=355968799) to review approved open requisitions.

## People Manager Responsibilities - People Programs

### Onboarding

We strive to provide a smooth onboarding experience that enables new hires into a safe and compliant working environment with a strong sense of belonging. Managers should familiarize themselves with onboarding in order to appropriately fill in any gaps for their new staff member. New staff members will have an Onboarding Checklist of activities to complete and join during their first 90 days.

We will continue to iterate and add activities to the Onboarding Program. Managers should review these responsibilities ahead of every new hire joining Mattermost. 

#### Pre-Day One

* Complete the [Systems Checklist Form](https://forms.gle/HhR6LyLrtGdDEZaQ7).
* Complete the [department onboarding template](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-on-boarding-guide#departmental-onboarding-checklists) prior to your new staff member's start date.
* Assign an Onboarding Peer \(Link w/ description to come\). The Onboarding Peer or peers should be an individual or group of people that can help answer questions about the team, department and Mattermost. In many ways, an Onboarding Peer may be an [end-boss](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#mini-boss-end-boss) for specific AORs. Managers should ask permission of a potential Onboarding Peer prior to assignment.

#### Week One

* Introduce our new staff member in the [Welcome Channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/welcome) using #newcolleague. Note: all new hires are asked to complete a short bio and share with their Managers. Managers should include this bio in the welcome message.

* Review Team [AORs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/areas-of-responsibility). This is also a good time to review the new hire's AOR and onboarding expectations.
* Review list of key internal partners the new staff member will work with and who the new staff member should set-up meetings with during their first month or two. 
* Mattermost channels: Ensure your team member is added to appropriate channels based on team and role.
* Team cadences: Review specific team cadences, operating norms and relevant playbooks.

#### Month One

* Review Company and Team [V2MOMs](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-v2mom).
* Align on role responsibitliies and expectations.
* New team members are invited to introduce themselves at [COM](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-com) during their second week. If they're not comfortable doing their own introduction, Managers will do so on their behalf.
* [Shoulder Check](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#shoulder-check), assess potential blindspots and ask for feedback.

#### Month Two

* **90-day New Colleague Feedback:** Managers are notified to kick off the [New Colleague Review Process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding#new-colleague-90-day-feedback-process) on their new staff member's 65th day. The feedback will include a summary of the new staff member's responsibilities during the first 90 days. Managers should communicate these responsibilities to the new staff member during their first week.

#### Month Three

* Deliver New Colleague Feedback.

### Performance Management

* **Performance Reviews:** Managers will be invited to a [High Output Management Managers Session](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/performance-reviews-50#high-output-management) ahead of writing a Performance Evaluation. Managers will need to read the [required chapter](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/performance-reviews-50#high-output-management) of High Output Management ahead of the Session. The book is also a part of the [Additional Training Resources](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#additional-training-resources) recommended for new Managers. It's suggested to read the book during onboarding or upon becoming a manager at Mattermost.
* **Performance Feedback:** Communicating explicitly is key in managing remote staff and teams and feedback is one of the most important tools a Manager has to set individuals and teams up for success.
  * Managers should address [Brown M&Ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms) and [Likes and Wishes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes) in a timely manner to ensure expectations are aligned and to maintain asynchronous communication.
  * [People Partners](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people#team) can help provide coaching and feedback on how to approach performance issues.
