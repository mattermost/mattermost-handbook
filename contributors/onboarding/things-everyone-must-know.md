# Things everyone must know

1. **Always use the term "country/region" and never "country"** in discussions, documentation and software design. Mattermost, Inc. may work with public sector organizations with a high degree of sensitivity to regions where the label "country" may be controversial.  
2. **Never sign on behalf of Mattermost, Inc.** Only the Mattermost, Inc. CEO can sign documents on behalf of the company, with the one and only exception being signing an on-site NDA \(non-disclosure agreement\) in order to enter a building. See [Risk Management in Agreements](../../operations/finance/risk-management/) documentation for instructions on having any agreement properly reviewed and initialed by someone Director-level or higher prior to CEO signature. 
3. **Escalate sensitive topics** seen in public sites such as the forums to the [Community Escalations channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/community-escalations), and follow the [Community Response Policy](../../operations/operations/company-policies/community-response-policy).
