# The Mattermost Community Writing Program

Mattermost wants to be a central resource for helping developers improve their productivity. To that end, we want to open our blog to our diverse community to share expertise, tips and tricks, guides, and other technical resources that help developers get work done. We’ll compensate authors whenever we publish their content.

## About you

We’re looking for a diverse group of skilled writers with deep technical knowledge to write content for us. You should have experience writing content, be comfortable receiving feedback about your work, and be open to making revisions recommended by our editorial team.

## Accepted topics

We seek a broad range of technical content for software developers that provide rich detail about popular tools. We typically prefer content that targets beginner to intermediate software developers, but we are open to a range of technical depth.

* How to use popular app frameworks like Node, React, Vue, Flask, Kotlin, machine learning frameworks, etc.
* Software development productivity hacks.
* Tips and tricks for popular software development tools.
* Unique DevOps infrastructure at scale.

### Special topics

We occasionally run special promotions to publish content on specific topics. Here are the unique opportunities we currently have available.

**Mattermost Playbooks integrations**

We want to show off all of the ways our community is integrating [Playbooks](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/playbooks.html) into their tech stack, including, but not limited to, the following tools:

* CI/CD tools like Travis CI, Circle CI, and Jenkins to automate building, testing, and deploying code changes.
* Monitoring, alerting, and data collection services like Moogsoft, Datadog, and PagerDuty.
* Cloud hosting services like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and Digital Ocean.
* Project management software like Jira, Clubhouse, Asana, and Trello.
* Code hosting, version control, and deployment orchestration tools like GitHub and GitLab.

The more technical the topic is, the better. We prefer content with real-world examples that show how to integrate Mattermost with these tools via webhooks, APIs, and other integrations frameworks. Recommended topics include incident response, code review, and release management, but anything that's related to the software development lifecycle will be considered. We pay $350 for all eligible articles.

## Compensation

Most authors receive $250 - $350 for publishing unique content, but exceptionally detailed content about prevalent technologies can earn up to $500. We also run regular events that offer bonuses for writing about specific topics.

## The process

1. **Submit your idea**: Submit your idea via our [application form](https://form.asana.com/?k=S5-Dbo0LVh8y4kmGJ1QPvg&d=279683980846511) with an outline of your content and a previous writing example demonstrating your technical knowledge and writing capabilities. We will only publish unique, first-run content where our blog is the first platform for it to be published.
2. **Refine**:Our editorial team will reach out to you to provide feedback on the idea and make any structural changes requests.
3. **Write your content**: Once we’ve approved your topic, it’s time to write the content. We'll provide additional guidelines and expectations to help you get started, but generally speaking, following Digital Ocean's [technical writing guidelines](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines) is a good plan.
4. **Revise**: Submit your initial draft to our editors, and we’ll collaborate with you to copyedit, design a hero image, and prepare the article for publication. You should 1-2 rounds of revisions over the next 1-2 weeks.
5. **Publish**: Once revisions are complete, we’ll send your compensation, publish the article, and promote it across all of our channels.
6. **Do it again**: There’s no limit to the number of articles you can publish through this program. We love to build long-term relationships with our community and would love for you to be a repeat author on our blog. Start at step 1 again and keep going!

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I get involved?**

Review our [process for submitting ideas](#the-process). When you submit a new idea, we’re going to ask you for details like:

* The article title and a summary of its contents.
* An outline of your article with descriptions about what each section of the article will cover.
* Information about prerequisite knowledge the reader will need to have.
* A link to a previous writing sample that demonstrates your capabilities.

Our editorial staff will reach out to let you know if we want to publish your content and will make recommendations for revisions. Once we’ve agreed that we’re happy with the idea, we’ll send you a contract that agrees on the scope of the article and the compensation. From there, it’s up to you to write the first draft and submit it for review!

**How do you evaluate content ideas?**

Our team reviews every submission, and we look for technical content that comprehensively covers software development topics with clear explanations. Explain as much detail as possible and leave no concepts out.

## Plagiarism policy

The Mattermost blog produces original, first-run content that has never been published previously on another website. All code, copy, images, and other content should be the result of the author's original thought, work, research, and self-expression. Mattermost will cease all work with any author that reproduces someone else's work to claim as their own. This includes borrowing content, wording, or organizational structure from another person or organization's published articles, code, documentation, or any other content resources.

Some examples of plagiarism include:

* Rewording existing blog posts to pass the content as your own.
* Copy and pasting external documentation without directly referencing the documentation source.
* Modifying someone else's code to change variable and function names, comments, and other non-essential elements.
* Using images from another source, even if you make modifications to that image.
* Failing to attribute content published under permissive licenses like the Creative Commons License.

If you're unsure about a question or concern related to plagiarism, please consult with the Mattermost content team before submission.

## Image use guidance

You may want to include images or other graphics to support your content in many situations.

Our design team will produce original artwork to serve as the hero image for your blog post, so you don’t need to provide images for this purpose. You’re free to include images in the body of your content; however, all images you submit must meet one of two criteria:

* The image must be 100% unique, original content, for which you are the copyright owner.
* The image must be permissively licensed under the International Creative Commons License or other similar licenses.

When using permissively-licensed images, you must provide a reference to the source to give proper attribution in the article. You’re welcome to provide references to use as inspiration, but please indicate that these references aren’t your original work when appropriate. In all situations, we reserve the right to recreate the images to fit the style of our blog or to improve the image as necessary.

## Diagrams and flowcharts

Diagrams and flowcharts are a great way to illustrate complicated technical details that include many components. If you’re capable of creating clean, easy-to-understand charts, you’re welcome to create original artwork to add to your content. If you have an idea for a diagram that would support your content but lack the skills or tools to create one, you can also include a rough sketch of your idea, and our design team can turn that into an attractive graphic. However, we have a limited capacity for this service, so we may need to adjust your idea to accommodate.

If you need help designing a diagram or flowchart, [this article has a ton of great information](https://www.smartdraw.com/flowchart/flowchart-tips.htm). Don’t forget, all materials you include in the illustration must meet our licensing requirements.

## Screenshots

Screenshots can be a great way to show visual representations of the instructions in your article. You might want to include screenshots of terminal output, tool configurations, or other items related to your content. If you have screenshots in your content, ensure that all content that appears in the image is your unique work and doesn’t include copyrighted images or other content from other sources.

To get the best screenshot, increase the font size of the text displayed in the image to something easily readable from a distance, crop screenshots to focus on elements relevant to the text, and remove unnecessary details when possible.
