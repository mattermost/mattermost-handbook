## FAQ

### Can I contribute code to the Mattermost Enterprise Edition code base with commercial features?

Generally we don't accept code contributions to the Mattermost Enterprise Edition commercial code base. There are exceptions when a strategic commercial customer is interested in co-developing commercial features with us, with sponsorship from executives on both the Mattermost and customer side, in which a special co-development agreement can be signed and contributions accepted.
