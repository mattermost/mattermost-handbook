# Community Systems

Here are few ways we engage with the [Mattermost community](https://mattermost.com/community/): 

- **Bugs:** [Search for existing bugs and file a GitHub issue if your bug is new](http://www.mattermost.org/filing-issues/). 
- **Feature Ideas:** [Add a feature idea to be discussed or upvoted](https://www.mattermost.org/feature-ideas/).
- **Troubleshoot:** [Search articles and add topic if issue is new](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/how-to-use-the-troubleshooting-forum/).
- **General discussion:** [Join the Mattermost Forum](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/welcome-to-the-mattermost-general-forum/). 
- **Contribute code:** Select tickets marked [Help Wanted](https://mattermost.com/pl/help-wanted-mattermost-server) and follow [contribution guidelines](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/). Join the [Contributors channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/tickets) to ask questions and discuss your work. 
- **Integrations:** [Let us know about your work so we can promote it!](https://www.mattermost.org/share-your-mattermost-projects/) Join the [Integrations and Apps channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/integrations) to discuss your project. 
- **Localization:** Join the [translation server](http://translate.mattermost.com/projects/mattermost/) to start translating right away. If your language isn't yet started, join our [Localization channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/localization) to request a new language, or to ask general questions and meet others in the community. Join language-specific channels to discuss translation work. 
- **Approved changes:** See [Jira database](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa) to view open, in-progress, resolved and closed tickets.
