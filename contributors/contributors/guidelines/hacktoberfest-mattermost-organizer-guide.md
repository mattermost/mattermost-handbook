# Hacktoberfest at Mattermost

Mattermost participates in the global Hacktoberfest event every year, and we invite participants to contribute to open source through coding, QA, translations, documentation, and security improvements.

Participants can earn digital badges and limited-edition swag. The event is a unique opportunity to engage with the Mattermost ecosystem while making a positive impact on the open source world.
