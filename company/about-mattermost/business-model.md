# Business Model

Mattermost uses a buyer-based open core business model to deliver a high trust, self-managed messaging platform for developers and high security end users. We develop a portfolio of offerings at different price points \(including free/open source\) that align to the needs and budgets of different buyers.

The free/open source version of Mattermost is built for **developers** as an innovative, flexible, high trust messaging platform that accelerates **collaboration** in DevOps workflows of a tight-knit team.

The paid enterprise edition of Mattermost is built for **team managers** and **IT professionals** as a flexible, high trust messaging platform that meets **compliance** needs in serving multiple teams of developers and end users in high security environments.

## Frequently asked questions

### What keeps other companies from using your open source software to create offerings that compete with your paid products?

We use the acronym "TACTICAL" to summarize the approach to maintaining differentiation of the paid version of our offerings to offerings a competitor may create from our open source code base:

* **Test infrastructure:** We use [SaaS QA](https://www.rainforestqa.com/) which isn't included in the open source version.
* **Alignment:** Developer features are free. Paid features are for managers and IT pros, who are less likely to spend time and effort forking and maintaining an open source project vs. deploying budgets to purchase paid features.
* **Core committers:** We work with an active community of [core committers](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#core-committers) to keep the project and business in sync.
* **Threat intelligence:** Mattermost's [responsible disclosure policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report) means forks will lag in threat intelligence.
* **Innovation:** Regular ship cycles and high velocity innovation rapidly lower the value of forks.
* **Compatibility:** Only genuine versions upgrade smoothly to new releases and security patches.
* **Architecture:** Modular architecture makes the need to fork rare.
* **Licensing:** Mattermost's trademark is registered internationally, forking requires renaming.

### What are the sales motions we use to reach prospects and turn them into customers? 

We're focused on a number of sales motions to turn prospects into customers: 

**Champion-Led Inbound Direct:** Prospect comes to us to buy. In this motion, developers or a System Admin deploys the open source or cloud free version of Mattermost, adopts its usage, and realizes value for a small group (~20 for cloud and 5-25 for self-hosted). When they want to scale usage beyond 25 and need administrative features like user management, SAML SSO, and the champion contacts IT and procurement to purchase. IT or procurement contacts Mattermost and is directed to the sales team to discuss a purchase, ask for volume discounting, answer security, compliance or technical questions, and/or negotiate MSA terms on their way to a purchase. 

In the meeting, Mattermost AE probes to get a detailed understanding of the customer’s situation and needs using a MEDPPICC framework, and works with the prospect’s IT, procurement, champion, economic buyer and other stakeholders to help the customer envision their success with Mattermost, complete an initial purchase, and set up the account for success in the post-purchase journey.

**Champion-Led Inbound Channel:** Similar to Champion-Led Inbound Direct journey except prospect buys through a channel partner rather than working with our sales team directly. In some cases we don’t have MEDPPICC information nor relationships with the key stakeholders at the accounts, and need to build up that context in order to properly connect with the account.

**Sales-Led Warm Outbound:** Identifying organizations where the free version of Mattermost is used, contacting people who didn’t reach out to us, and selling our way to close a new customer. In this journey, the Mattermost sales team, either BDR or AE depending on region and segment, identifies an account where someone seems to be running the open source version of Mattermost (through webchat, contact requests, E0 download data, cloud trials, enterprise trials, noticing “Mattermost” skillsets in LinkedIn profiles, etc.), identifies potential contacts (using ZoomInfo, LeadIQ/LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Demandbase and other resources), and outbounds (via email, LinkedIn, and social media) to different personas in the target organization to eventually connect with Mattermost champions, and for the AE to share the vision, benefits, use cases, ROI and case studies of our commercial offerings, along with technical pre-sales support, and guide the prospect into becoming a customer.

**Sales-Led Cold Outbound:** Selling into organizations that aren’t known to be using Mattermost but who are similar to existing Mattermost customers and could potentially benefit from our offerings. This starts with BDRs and AEs focusing on a list of organizations--”Named accounts”--that aren’t known to use Mattermost, but are similar to existing customers who benefit from Mattermost, finding and contacting the right people at the organization to share about the ROI and benefits of Mattermost solutions, getting meetings, and getting agreement to run a trial to prove that Mattermost would solve the issues the prospect is facing, running the trial with technical pre-sales support, and closing customers who can understand the vision for how Mattermost solves their urgent needs, with a proof of value in the trial to validate the purchase they are making.

**Channel-Led Outbound:** In some countries/regions channel partners may execute Sales-Led outbound motions in partnership with our sales teams. This motion can be particularly additive in countries/regions and organizations with languages and culture that can’t yet be supported with our internal sales organization, or to reach the existing customer base of a channel partner who are likely to have similar needs to existing Mattermost customers and likely to buy (e.g. Carahsoft/FedResults).
