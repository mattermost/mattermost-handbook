# Vision 

Our vision is becoming the leading solution for developer collaboration through an integrated suite of open core tools that accelerate developer productivity, increase software service levels, and raise workplace satisfaction among technical teams. 

As the world moves more digital and remote, technical organizations face mounting challenges: stagnating productivity, increasing exposure to outages and service-level degradations, and declining workplace satisfaction leading to staffing churn and expanding talent gaps. 

We solve these issues for customers by developing and delivering an open, flexible, developer-focused collaboration suite competing against both point solutions (Slack, Asana/Trello/Notion, WebEx/Zoom/Loom, RunDeck/Transposit/Firehydrant, Confluence/GitHuge Pages) and general-purpose collaboration suites (Microsoft Teams/Office, G Suite). 

We deliver our solutions through an open core, product-led growth motion with freemium offerings that flow into usage and conversion from free-to-paid supported by Mattermost champions in customer accounts, frictionless self-serve purchase experience on both cloud and self-hosted instances, and both direct fulfillment and channel-based fulfillment depending on customer preferences and our ability to provide regional support. This motion is accelerated through our BDR and field sales motions with warm outbound into our freemium install base, plus cold outbound into named enterprise accounts driving awareness of the ROI of Mattermost solutions from like customers.

# Market 

Analysts project that in 2022, over $4.5 Trillion USD will be spent on IT. What portion of that investment turns into productivity and results depends entirely on how well teams of software builders and operators can effectively collaborate. 

Mattermost competes in a $15B market for "developer collaboration", a segment of the boarder general collaboration market focused on accelerating developer productivity through agile workflows across application development, digital operations and security operations. Our focus is serving a market of 30 million developers with an integrated, open core collaboration suite across workplace messaging, project management, incident management, real time communication, and documentation available both in cloud and as a self-hosted component of an organization's digital infrastructure. 

Many of these organizations are facing three critical challenges: 

**Stagnant and Declining Developer Productivity in Post-Remote Environments** - While many technical organizations accelerated productivity in the initial move to remote work--decreasing commute time, onsite logistics, and interruptions--many post-remote environments now suffer from gaps in clarity and alignment that in-office environments provided in the past. The context created by in-person meetings, hallway conversations, war rooms--and even by physical whiteboards and post-it notes--continues to degrade in many organizations. Digital substitutes across meeting organization, note taking, workplace messaging, incident response, and project management have exploded as point solutions. They served as life rafts during the pandemic, but the misfit of teams, tools and workflows is now becoming an overwhelming tax--copy and pasting, inconsistent formatting, unclear access controls, redundancy of information, and the breakage of flow.

**Increasing Vendor Lock-in and Outage Exposure** - In many organizations the acceleration to cloud has dramatically increased vendor-dependency, data lock-in, and exposure to the business disruption. In some cases, there is risk of both a company’s technical infrastructure and online collaboration tools going down at the same time when they are outsourced to the same vendor, or share dependencies--especially cloud dependencies. These risks may be dramatically heightened with remote work if incident response teams don’t have either a secure physical location to work on mitigations, or online collaboration tools independent of the underlying outage. Moreover, as cloud vendors control more and more of their customer’s data and operations, businesses have fewer options to hold vendors accountable. 

**Gaps in Workplace Satisfaction for Technical Talent** - Acceleration in remote hiring coupled with a surge in global demand has made staffing developer organizations an unprecedented challenge. Workplace satisfaction is now more important than ever as a leading indicator of organizational success. Satisfaction includes both conceptual factors, such as opportunities for impact, connection and growth, and concrete factors such as the technologies and tools teams get to operate. Winning on workplace satisfaction in conceptual and concrete factors is a leading indicator of meeting the capacity needs of digital operations organizations, which is a leading factor to market relevance. 

# Business Model

Mattermost uses a buyer-based open core business model to deliver a high trust, self-managed messaging platform for developers and high security end users. We develop a portfolio of offerings at different price points \(including free/open source\) that align to the needs and budgets of different buyers.

1. **Free** - The free/open source version of Mattermost is built for **developers** as an innovative, flexible, high trust messaging platform that accelerates collaboration in the agile workflows of a tight-knit team.

2. **Team** - Our entry-level paid version, Mattermost Professional, is built for **team managers**--commonly managers of managers--who need additional controls and workflows specific to multi-team coordination. This version can be purchased via self-service, through resellers, or--for accounts over a certain size in certain territories--transacted through our sales team. 

3. **Enterprise** - As usage of Mattermost grows we have a high scale edition, Mattermost Enterprise, providing enterprise compliance features and high scale support, including self-managed, multi-node, high availability configurations.  



## Frequently asked questions

### What keeps other companies from using your open source software to create offerings that compete with your paid products?

We use the acronym "TACTICAL" to summarize the approach to maintaining differentiation of the paid version of our offerings to offerings a competitor may create from our open source code base:

* **Test infrastructure:** We use [SaaS QA](https://www.rainforestqa.com/) which isn't included in the open source version.
* **Alignment:** Developer features are free. Paid features are for managers and IT pros, who are less likely to spend time and effort forking and maintaining an open source project vs. deploying budgets to purchase paid features.
* **Core committers:** We work with an active community of [core committers](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms#core-committers) to keep the project and business in sync.
* **Threat intelligence:** Mattermost's [responsible disclosure policy](https://mattermost.com/security-vulnerability-report) means forks will lag in threat intelligence.
* **Innovation:** Regular ship cycles and high velocity innovation rapidly lower the value of forks.
* **Compatibility:** Only genuine versions upgrade smoothly to new releases and security patches.
* **Architecture:** Modular architecture makes the need to fork rare.
* **Licensing:** Mattermost's trademark is registered internationally, forking requires renaming.
