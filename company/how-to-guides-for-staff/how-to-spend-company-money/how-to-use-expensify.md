# How to use Expensify

Expensify is our global expense tracking software for all reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses. All expenses, regardless of cost, must include an itemized receipt for tracking and approving purposes. As part of your onboarding experience, you will be provisioned on one or more Expensify policies depending on your level and if you have direct reports. If you do not have an Expensify account, please reach out to the [Finance Team](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases) who will provision you with an Expensify account.

## PREPARING AND SUBMITTING EXPENSE REPORTS

When preparing an expense report, you should consolidate the report based on the activity\(ies\).

Monthly Recurring Expense activities should be consolidated on one [Expense Report](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report) monthly. These include mobile reimbursement, flexible office space, and more.

Non-Recurring Expense activities should be broken up by event and separated by an [Expense Report](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report). Common events include the following

* **Travel**: you should have 2 expense reports:

1. **Flight expense report**: This will include airfare paid for in advance of your trip.
2. **Travel expense report**: This will include hotel, meals, uber/taxis, etc. incurred during the time of your travel.

* **Equipment**: When onboarding, all expenses should be submitted on the same expense report in the month incurred

Expenses for the same trip or report that is submitted on multiple [Expense Report](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report) \(e.g. in piecemeal\) will be pushed back to the submitter to amend.

All expenses should be submitted timely and therefore we request that expenses incurred in the month are submitted in an expense report within the same month. Long outstanding receipts submitted outside the month incurred are subject to additional review and in certain cases could be rejected.

### CREATING A REPORT

You can go about creating a report in Expensify in two ways: Create the report before you incur expense and add the expenses as they arise or consolidate all your expenses from your trip/event/onboarding and apply them to report. To create a report, follow the directions below:

1. On the left hand corner of your home screen, you will see an icon with your name and 4 tabs vertically down a dark ribbon: Inbox, Expenses, Reports, and Settings. Click Reports \(as seen below\)

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W6IMHtjgCfl6NG3EZ6hU42Sw5dEhDMrUSZI2_kZSh5ToR9hFjBqpHm9gBp1s_Da9h4JugmceDBnceYaoaNjClRJHkoh3hyN1NMt162ua7NJ5OXQdq3sMTBCGHLTmciERJszakVTa)

1. This opens to a Reports page where you can create a “New Report” located in the upper right hand corner of your screen \(as seen below\).

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kQkvDLFjvR_Z_9sM7yIUp_RNYftuiZJsQAGyzj71VEq30GYRMiv-w6s3p9FlkHoGEu1DkffgHFWA5ptk78lImnUp1lOh3ecNyu4vRsyJl5waiVblsHJ96koF5YOjhhe4n37CDi2r)

1. Clicking “New Report” will automatically populate a report where you can begin to add expenses to. Note that the Report Name is auto generated with the following information on your profile \(as seen below\):
   1. Name: First and Last
   2. Start Date: First date an expense was incurred on your report
   3. End Date: Last date an expense was incurred on your report
   4. Report Number: Auto generated by Expensify
   5. Currency: The primary currency you will be reimbursed in

It is also important that you are submitting under the correct policy \(as seen below\). Please double check this information before proceeding.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GxTZZHtyymVE8hikQfyDrBOEpuwHJ_sr6L6mK3vosudI6XqM0TrEDOIlNeelzq3b74duoTyi3M8icdU_V26J5wog79JuAf2EQW3if9Lm_8hn8ecVsPm0K3jYKR0loWU2SIUbLE6s)

1. At this time, you can begin to [add receipts](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#adding-receipts)

### ADDING RECEIPTS

Receipts are relatively easy to add. You can add expenses in one of two ways: directly to the report you created or standalone where you can add to a report at a later date. It is best practice that once you have received a bill or receipt for your expense, either log into your Expensify account or use the Expensify mobile app to take a screenshot of your receipt\(s\) and upload them to your expense que \(as seen below\). You can use Expensify’s “SmartScanning” technology to pre-populate some of the information. Alternative, you can manually fill in the details yourself.

Once you have more time to sit down and sift through your expenses, you can then code these to the correct reports.

1. Adding expenses to the “Expenses” queue by navigating to the left hand corner of your home screen where you will see an icon with your name and 4 tabs vertically down a dark ribbon: Inbox, Expenses, Reports, and Settings. Click Expenses \(as seen below\)

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zW1BAEbgUzbF_DB343Kw6kh3ToJAh--vUslTURFbOBIvn3Q6TICf18ELOlxv6_FxO8B4u7TPrHuvyFiJTq6kvN_4Ugs_emWCyp7-4kNgrGN2RP71ZKWmQvBlE0cSJacwvkV0Wf5K)

1. Once on the expense page, you can view existing expenses not yet filed to an Expense Report or create a “New Expense” \(as seen below\)

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/REL1YWv_BFVjDwCmLzcX0WYDQFA0mzsOrPEKkkMw1mxBe7Htme2Rq1OqcCEq1Riwf5b3hDZmBcmavedUw79UE9WaqorWtMSJK9AIZTgdB7c0gKra8va2AeogiJ56Tl2wu9BmsrX7)

1. Under “New Expenses”, you can choose to upload your receipt in one of three ways: 1\) Scan Receipt; Manually Create; or Create Multiple \(as seen below\). It is best practice to Scan or Manually Create a receipt to avoid any complications and expense processing issues.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sgXwg0rTGH2Fnh2NgVrmYZyb5uScWnbeGEkpmo2IlYuf4XOYfn1C9Hz1jdhuwngPGcf8PgEKiIWGnBfTH84_tr_lvS4EE9lp7qI8c5hdxaRmbtSAXRN6LW-MKApy509LQQn6zGfE)

1. For Manually Created expenses, you will be taken to a screen \(as seen below\) to begin coding your expenses. For Scanned Receipts, you will first need to select a file from your drive to upload for SmartScanning.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yE3l-Bual-Ub5LGbkD50f-azi0pzQHZhELvG_8VGEfRQpJtn3HsU3xYEGDHOGr-4PQlymgr3n2Y-4kWee9h0x6lqv1CttalHBa0HZxQyB16EalOatvcLT05HyibpR8yLN1kclGVj)

1. For new expenses, all fields are mandatory to complete. Below is the list and purpose of each category for submitting at Mattermost:
   1. **Merchant**: This is the vendor with whom you incurred the expense
   2. **Date**: The date noted on the receipt
   3. **Total**: Amount billed and the currency in which the expense was incurred
   4. **Category**: Category is an important and mandatory field as the coding directly impacts the face of the financial statements and P&L. This is a very important field that should be reviewed and considered thoughtfully. We have provided detailed descriptions and examples for each [Category](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#categories) below. Should you have questions please reach out the the [Purchases](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases) channel.
   5. **Attendees**: This should include all individuals \(staff member or external person\) involved in the expense. For example, a dinner with a customer should include the names of all the customers and internal staff members who attended.
   6. **Classification**: This is a mandatory field that impacts budgetary reporting. To facilitate the correct categorization, we have provided detailed descriptions and examples for each [Classification](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#classification) below. Should you have questions or if you find there is no classification relevant to the expense, please reach out to the [Purchases](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/purchases) channel.
   7. **Description**: All expenses should have a description for the business need. The more detail the better. Please see below for examples that can be used to guide you in completing this filed. 
      1. **Example 1**: John Smith just bought his new onboarding equipment which includes a Lenovo Carbon X laptop and an AmazonBasics HDMI Cable in Houston, Texas. Below are examples of expense descriptions:
         1. Carbon X Lenovo Laptop  for onboarding
         2. HDMI cable for onboarding
      2. **Example 2**: Alison Henry has just completed her trip to Sweden where she met the VP of IT for Spotify. She incurred the following business expenses while on her trip: United flight roundtrip, dinner at Morrison Steakhouse, and a personal breakfast at the Hilton Hotel. Below are examples of expense descriptions:
         1. Flight to visit Spotify at headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden
         2. Spotify customer dinner at Morrison Steakhouse in Stockholm, Sweden
         3. Hotel stay at Hilton in Stockholm, Sweden for Spotify

Once your expense has been completed, you can add this to an existing Expense Report or let it stay in the Expenses queue until such time as you are ready to add it to a trip/event/onboarding report.

## WHEN APPROVING AN EXPENSE REPORT

If you are a manager and reviewing a staff member's expense report, the below instructions should be followed:

1. When an [Expense Report](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-use-expensify#creating-a-report) has been submitted by a staff member, Expensify will send a notification via email to the manager for review
2. Click on the report name in the body of the email and you will be directed to Expensify where you can review the report
3. Review each expense for accuracy and completeness as aligned in the Mattermost’s expense policy, and ensure a receipt is attached. Note: we require a receipt for all expenses.
4. Once reviewed and approved, Select **\[Approve and Forward\]** \(as seen below\) on the option drop down and Expensify will designate a pre-populated email address.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/K95GGduA7yvphRDt0PrdEAAUHHVwy7A_NwDGYbVFXTGpxMraLxzizOCPJaZSnQvmxpu_wBH20QZdAEp58uwnOC51MO3Mtx-gF8OuEz6BbsDR1bT7rEi0BQYzjNwGa-4_ZdQtwz0u)

**IMPORTANT** - **please do not use \[Final Approval\]** because Expensify will not send the email notification for payment approval and it will delay the reimbursement process.

1. If you will be Out Of Office, the manager can delegate the approval process during PTO \(as seen below\):

   _Settings → Your Account → Account Details → Vacation Delegate → Enter the email address of the backup approval_

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DjLOEFPKcjOWAuh6QAS98ysglxPSedRmskUPEdqF9dbu_nOzPHAQXK7DjU_P5G8q-9oKE8wrv3A8Sqt0kX6O4YZ8scEyPAxLqjHE7XVGAosvSW8vSpPz8APQRSi80iPAKkBi5IGU)

## Expense Reimbursement Policy

Our goal is to reimburse staff members timely. We reimburse twice a month on the 15th and last day of every month. To be reimbursed timely, all expense reports must be submitted and manager approved 3 days prior to reimbursement. The primary reason for this is Finance needs to review for proper classification and to timely fund your bank account.

It’s important to note that an expense report approved by your manager does not automatically mean the expense is approved internally or ready to be reimbursed. As all expense reports are final-reviewed and approved by the Finance Team, you may be asked for additional support, justification, or to move expenses to a second report to meet our [Expense Report Policy](https://handbook.mattermost.com/education/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-spend-company-money/how-to-use-expensify#preparing-and-submitting-expense-reports).

### United States Payment

If you are located in the United States, you are required to set up your banking account information so that you can receive a direct deposit of reimbursable funds to your account.

### Open World Services \(OWS\)

If you are located in Canada or employed through OWS, you will receive reimbursement via OWS. All reports once Final Approved should be downloaded and submitted to Cindy Hindley `cindy@openworldservices.net`

### Rest of World \(ROW\)

For everyone else, a Bill.com account will need to be setup. If you already have a bill.com account and being reimbursed by Mattermost at this time, you may disregard. If you are needing to set up a bill.com account, please work with the [Accounts Payable Team](mailto:ap@mattermost.com) who will create your profile in bill.com for you. If you are uncertain, please reach out to the [Accounts Payable Team](mailto:ap@mattermost.com) for guidance. To ensure accuracy and expediency, please complete [Mattermost Banking Information Form](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-get-paid#banking-form) which the [Accounts Payable Team](mailto:ap@mattermost.com) will use to setup your credentials.
