## How to make a payment to Mattermost

Once you have completed your report, please use the [Bank Payment Information](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k2iiBMpnrspkUCezfngck7Vxd7n2NUd4/view?usp=sharing) to refund the company. We currently offer two payment options: ACH/Wire or Check

### Wire/ACH/Funds Transfer

If you elect to reimburse via Wire/ACH, you are responsible for the Payer and Payee fees, if any. In other words, the cash refund received should not be net of fees. In the description field, please indicate the 8 digit Expensify Report Number\(s\) so that Finance may properly apply the payment to the report upon receipt.

### Check

Make checks payable to Mattermost, Inc. and in the memo field indicate the 8 digit Expensify Report Number\(s\) so that Finance may properly apply the payment to the report upon receipt. Checks should be mailed to the address listed below:
