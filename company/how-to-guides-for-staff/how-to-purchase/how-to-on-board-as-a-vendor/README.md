# Vendor Onboarding

**Effective Date**: January 1, 2021

If you're a new full-time staff member who will be issuing Mattermost a monthly or bi-monthly invoice, new vendor supplying goods or services, or a contractor to Mattermost, you will need to onboard as a new vendor with the [Finance Team](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/expenses).

## New Vendor or Contractor

After your contract has gone through our [procurement process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-purchase/how-to-procure-a-vendor-contract), the [Finance Team](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/expenses) will set up your vendor in Accrualify. The Finance team will send the vendor a Welcome email to the vendor portal. In the portal, the vendor can provide their basic information and banking information, as well as provide their appropriate tax documents like:

1. [Form W-9](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) \(please click [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw9.pdf) for IRS guidelines\) (US vendors)
2. [Form W-8BEN](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) \(please click [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw8ben.pdf) for IRS guidelines\) (Non-US vendors)
3. [Form W-8BENE](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8bene.pdf) \(please click [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw8bene.pdf) for IRS guidelines\) (Non-US vendors)

## Invoicing and Payment

For timely payment, invoices should be sent to [AP@mattermost.com](mailto:AP@mattermost.com) or uploaded into the vendor portal. For further information on receiving payment by Mattermost, please refer to the [How to get paid](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/how-to-guides-for-staff/how-to-get-paid) page.
