## Contracts and Signing

After your puchase order has been fully approved on Accrualify, the related legal document, which would have been reviewed and approved by Legal, will be sent out internally for signatures. For additional information on who can sign on behalf of the company, please refer to the [Company Agreement](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/company-agreements) page.

Please note that legal documents sent by outside organizations via email, DocuSign, HelloSign, etc. **will not** be signed by [Contract Accountability Owners](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/company-agreements#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos).

If you have additional questions on this process, please reach out to the [Procurement team](procurement@mattermost.com).
