# How to manage Mattermost Handbook notifications

If you're receiving too many Mattermost Handbook notifications, you can control what you're notified about by going to https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook, selecting the **Watch** icon in top right corner, then selecting your notification preferences.

Choose the **Not Watching** option to be notified only if you're participating in a GitHub issue or pull request (e.g. submitting a pull request), or are @mentioned.
