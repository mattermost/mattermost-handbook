# How to set up a 1-1 channel

## Getting started

1. **Create a Google Doc** and name the file `[INITIALS_OF_FIRST_PERSON]-[INITIALS_OF_SECOND_PERSON] 1-1`.
   - For example. if Bob Adrian Jones is meeting with Jen Tai Yin Lee, the title of the file would be `BAJ-JTL 1-1.`
   - Use three letter initials when possible since there may be people with the same initials. 
2. **Share the file** with the other person, using the **Share** option in the Google Doc.
3. Create a Direct Message channel in Mattermost and add the other person. 
3. **Add a link to the Google Doc** at the top of the Direct Message channel by editing the header of the channel. Choose **Edit Header** and paste the link. 
4. **Use the file for 1-1s** to post material in advance and to write notes of your discussions.
