# How to do an unscheduled post-mortem

In the spirit of iterating and continuous improvement, after hitting a significant or repeated issue we should write-up an unscheduled post-mortem and share it with the team. 

This should take 5-10 minutes to prepare.   
  
Following the resolution, the person with the most knowledge of the issue should send an email to the group with the following summary: 

1. What was the issue? 
2. What might be done to improve our outcomes in future? 
3. What are we changing in our process and/or documentation \(if anything\) it improve future outcomes? 

By taking a moment to reflect, we have the opportunity to uplevel and create lasting change and improvement.
