# How to update handbook

## Guidelines

* **Be concise:** Say what is essential, not more. 
* **Get feedback:** Have someone from your target audience read your draft to share feedback so you can [savor surprises](../about-mattermost/mindsets.md#savor-surprises).

## Steps

If this is your first time contributing to Mattermost, first read the [Mattermost Contributor Agreement](https://www.mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) and sign it \(at the bottom of the page\), so you can be added to the Mattermost [Approved Contributor List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NTCeG-iL_VS9bFqtmHSfwETo5f-8MQ7oMDE5IUYJi_Y/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true). Please ensure the **GitHub username** field matches your username exactly on GitHub, including capitalization.

### Editing an Existing Page

1. The quickest way to begin is navigating to the page you want to edit in [Mattermost Handbook](https://handbook.mattermost.com/), then clicking the **Edit on GitHub** icon in the top right navigation. This opens the page in GitHub that you can edit.
2. In GitHub click the pencil icon in the navigation bar \(above the page header\) called **Edit the file in your fork of this project** to open the editable Markdown format page. 

  * To learn more about Markdown formatting, see the [Mattermost guide for formatting text](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/formatting-text.html), or [the guide from GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).

3. Make your edits. When you're ready to submit your changes, scroll to the bottom of the page to commit your changes and start a pull request.
4. Add a descriptive title if the default title isn't sufficient. Add an extended description to summarize the changes you've made.
5. Click the **Propose file change** button.

6. On the next page, scroll down to compare changes with the original document and then select **Create pull request**.
7. Confirm that the title and description are correct. Then select **Create pull request**.

Once a pull request has been submitted, a core committer with write-access assigns relevant reviewers and labels to kick off the review process. The review process includes aligning the content with the Style Guide, validating the changes, and tagging any other relevant committers.

Multiple committers may comment on your pull request and provide edits or suggestions which you can commit directly. You can also add line comments. Take a look at [Commenting on pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) for more details.

Once the review process is complete, the change is merged and pushed live. We recommend that you review your changes at [https://handbook.mattermost.com](https://handbook.mattermost.com) for potential formatting errors.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I format a page?

All Handbook pages are written in Markdown, which is also the language used to post messages in Mattermost. To learn more about Markdown formatting, see the [Mattermost guide for formatting text](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/formatting-text.html), or [the guide from GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).

### How do I create a new page?

Creating a new page follows the same process as above, with two exceptions:

* Navigate to that section of the handbook where you'd like to add the new page and select **Create new file**.
* Add your new page to the [Handbook table of contents](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/blob/0.2.1/SUMMARY.md).
