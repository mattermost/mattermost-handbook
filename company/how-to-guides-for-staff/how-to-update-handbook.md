# How to update the handbook
 
### Guidelines 
 
* **Be concise:** Say what is essential, not more. 
* **Get feedback:** Have someone from your target audience read your draft to share feedback so you can [savor surprises](../about-mattermost/mindsets.md#savor-surprises).
 
### Steps
 
#### 1 - Getting Started
 
The quickest way to begin is navigating to the page you want to edit in [Mattermost Handbook](https://handbook.mattermost.com/), then clicking the **Edit on GitHub** icon in the top right navigation. This opens the page in GitHub that you can edit.
 
If this is your first time contributing to Mattermost, first read the [Mattermost Contributor Agreement](https://www.mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) and sign it (at the bottom of the page), so you can be added to the Mattermost [Approved Contributor List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NTCeG-iL_VS9bFqtmHSfwETo5f-8MQ7oMDE5IUYJi_Y/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).
 
#### 2 - Editing an Existing Page
 
After you have opened the page you want to edit in GitHub, click the **Edit** pencil icon in the top right corner.
 
This opens a Markdown formatted document of the page. To learn more about Markdown formatting, see the [Mattermost guide for formatting text](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/formatting-text.html), or [the guide from GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).
 
#### 3 - Creating a Pull Request
 
When you're ready to submit your changes, scroll to the bottom of the page to commit your changes.
 
Add a descriptive title and comments to summarize the changes made, then select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.
 
After this, click the **Propose file change** button.
 

 
Scroll down to compare changes with the original document, request **Reviewers** on the top right navigation, then select **Create pull request**. 

#### 4 - Commenting on a Pull Request
 
Once a pull request is submitted, multiple committers may comment on it and provide edits or suggestions which you can commit directly. You can also add line comments. Take a look at [Commenting on pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) for more details.
 
#### 5 - Reviewing a Pull Request
 
Once a pull request has been submitted and the correct label assigned, the review process begins. This includes aligning the content with the Style Guide, validating processes, and tagging any other relevant committers.
 
Once the review process is complete, the change is merged and pushed live. We recommend you to review your changes at https://handbook.mattermost.com for potential formatting errors.
 
### Things to Know
 
1 - All Handbook pages are written in Markdown formatting, which is also the language used to post messages in Mattermost. To learn more about Markdown formatting, see the [Mattermost guide for formatting text](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/formatting-text.html), or [the guide from GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).
 
2 - Creating a new page follows the same process above, except in this case you cannot simply edit an existing page. Instead
navigate to that section of the handbook that you want to add a new page for, and select **Create new file**.
add your new page to the [handbook table of contents](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/blob/0.2.1/SUMMARY.md).
 
From here, follow the same steps detailed above.
 

 
3 - To add an image to your documentation, follow these two steps:
 
* Go to the [/assets](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-handbook/tree/0.2.1/.gitbook/assets) folder, click **Upload files**, then upload the image files you want to add to your documentation. Make sure to have a clear name for each file you upload.
* Go to the section you want to add an image to and include the following Markdown formatting
