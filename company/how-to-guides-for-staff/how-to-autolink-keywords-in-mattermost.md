# How to autolink keywords in Mattermost

On the [Mattermost Community Server](https://community.mattermost.com), specific keywords in messages, such as MLT, display and behave as links that take you to a documented definition of the word MLT. These keyword links are particularly helpful for new Mattermost staff members ramping up on Mattermost-specific terms and processes.

We often refer to these hyperlinked keywords as *autolinks* because they're created using a Mattermost plugin called [Autolink](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-autolink). 

To add a new autolink on the Mattermost Community Server:

1. Define the word and URL to autolink on. For example, the term ISP is linked to the [issue/solution process](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-processes/issue-solution) documentation in the [Mattermost Handbook](https://handbook.mattermost.com).
2. On the Mattermost Community Server in the [Community Configuration channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/community-configuration), ask to help add the new autolink to the Mattermost server. This ensures that everyone on the Mattermost Community Server benefits from having a quick definition at their fingertips when the term is used in messages and threads.
